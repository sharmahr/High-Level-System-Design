Here is my solution to designing Google Calendar:

**Step 1: Clarify Requirements and Assumptions**

- The calendar system should allow users to create, view, update, and delete events
- Events should have attributes such as title, description, start time, end time, location, attendees, and reminders
- Users should be able to invite other users to events and manage attendee responses (e.g., accept, decline, tentative)
- The system should support recurring events (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)
- Users should be able to share their calendars with other users and set different access levels (e.g., view, edit)
- The system should provide a user-friendly interface for viewing events in different formats (e.g., day, week, month)
- The system should handle a large number of users and events and provide fast response times
- Assume the system needs to support 100 million users
- Assume an average of 10 events per user per month

**Step 2: Back of the Envelope Estimations**

- Number of users: 100 million
- Average events per user per month: 10
- Total events per month: 100 million * 10 = 1 billion
- Assuming an average event size of 1 KB (including attributes and attendee information), total storage per month: 1 billion * 1 KB ≈ 1 TB
- Assuming a 5-year retention period, total storage required: 1 TB * 12 months * 5 years ≈ 60 TB

**Step 3: High-Level Architecture**

API Design:
- `createEvent(userId, eventData)`: Creates a new event for the user
- `getEvent(userId, eventId)`: Retrieves an event by its ID
- `updateEvent(userId, eventId, eventData)`: Updates an existing event
- `deleteEvent(userId, eventId)`: Deletes an event
- `getCalendar(userId, startDate, endDate)`: Retrieves a user's calendar events within a specified date range
- `inviteAttendee(userId, eventId, attendeeEmail)`: Invites an attendee to an event
- `respondToInvite(userId, eventId, response)`: Allows an attendee to respond to an event invitation
- `shareCalendar(userId, targetUserId, accessLevel)`: Shares a user's calendar with another user

Data Model:
- User:
  - userId (unique identifier)
  - name
  - email
  - ...
- Event:
  - eventId (unique identifier)
  - userId (user who created the event)
  - title
  - description
  - startTime
  - endTime
  - location
  - recurrence (e.g., none, daily, weekly, monthly)
  - ...
- Attendee:
  - attendeeId (unique identifier)
  - eventId (event the attendee is invited to)
  - userId (user invited as an attendee)
  - response (e.g., accepted, declined, tentative)
  - ...
- CalendarShare:
  - shareId (unique identifier)
  - userId (user sharing the calendar)
  - targetUserId (user the calendar is shared with)
  - accessLevel (e.g., view, edit)
  - ...

Database:
- A combination of relational and non-relational databases can be used
- User and CalendarShare data can be stored in a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for structured data and efficient querying
- Event and Attendee data can be stored in a non-relational database (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) for scalability and flexibility

Key Components:
- API Gateway: Handles incoming requests, performs authentication and authorization, and routes requests to the appropriate services
- Calendar Service: Manages the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of events and handles calendar sharing and attendee invitations
- Event Storage: Stores event data, including title, description, start time, end time, location, and recurrence
- Attendee Storage: Stores attendee information and their responses to event invitations
- Calendar Sharing: Manages the sharing of calendars between users and enforces access control based on the specified access levels
- Notification Service: Sends notifications to users for event invitations, updates, and reminders
- Web/Mobile App: Provides the user interface for interacting with the calendar system

**Step 4: Detailed Design**

Event Creation and Management:
1. When a user creates an event, the API Gateway receives the request and forwards it to the Calendar Service
2. The Calendar Service validates the event data and stores it in the Event Storage
3. If the event includes attendees, the Calendar Service sends invitations to the specified attendees via the Notification Service
4. Attendees can respond to the invitations, and their responses are stored in the Attendee Storage
5. The Calendar Service handles event updates and deletions, making the necessary changes in the Event Storage

Calendar Sharing:
1. When a user shares their calendar with another user, the API Gateway receives the request and forwards it to the Calendar Service
2. The Calendar Service creates a new entry in the Calendar Sharing database, specifying the user sharing the calendar, the target user, and the access level
3. When the target user accesses the shared calendar, the Calendar Service checks the Calendar Sharing database to determine the appropriate access level and retrieves the relevant events from the Event Storage

Notifications:
1. The Notification Service sends notifications to users for various events, such as event invitations, updates, and reminders
2. When an event is created or updated with attendees, the Calendar Service sends a notification request to the Notification Service
3. The Notification Service retrieves the necessary user information and sends notifications via email, push notifications, or other configured channels

Recurring Events:
1. Recurring events are stored in the Event Storage with additional metadata indicating the recurrence pattern (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)
2. When retrieving events for a specific date range, the Calendar Service expands the recurring events based on their recurrence patterns
3. Updates to recurring events can be applied to a single instance or all future instances, depending on the user's choice

**Step 5: Scalability, Performance, Consistency, Availability**

Scalability:
- **The system can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances of the Calendar Service to handle increased load**
- **The Event Storage and Attendee Storage can be partitioned based on user ID or event ID to distribute the data across multiple nodes**
- **Caching can be used to store frequently accessed events and calendar data to reduce the load on the database**
- **The Notification Service can be scaled independently to handle a high volume of notifications**

Performance:
- **Indexing can be used in the Event Storage and Attendee Storage to enable fast querying and retrieval of events and attendee information**
- **Caching frequently accessed events and calendar data can significantly improve read performance**
- **The Calendar Service can use techniques like pagination and lazy loading to efficiently load and display events in the user interface**

Consistency:
- **Eventual consistency can be achieved for event updates and attendee responses, allowing for faster write operations**
- **Strong consistency can be enforced for critical data, such as event creation and deletion, to ensure data integrity**
- **Atomic operations and transactions can be used when updating multiple related entities, such as updating an event and sending notifications**

Availability:
- **The system should be designed for high availability by deploying multiple instances of the Calendar Service and Notification Service across different regions or availability zones**
- **The Event Storage and Attendee Storage should use replication and failover mechanisms to ensure data durability and availability**
- **Load balancing can be used to distribute traffic evenly across the available instances of the Calendar Service**
- **Monitoring and alerting mechanisms should be in place to detect and resolve any issues or failures in the system**

**Summary of Key Points**

To design Google Calendar:

1. Use a combination of relational and non-relational databases to store structured data (User, CalendarShare) and flexible data (Event, Attendee)
2. Implement an API Gateway to handle incoming requests, perform authentication and authorization, and route requests to the appropriate services
3. Design a Calendar Service to manage event creation, retrieval, updating, deletion, and handle calendar sharing and attendee invitations
4. Utilize separate storage for events (Event Storage) and attendees (Attendee Storage) to allow for scalability and flexibility
5. Implement a Calendar Sharing component to manage the sharing of calendars between users and enforce access control
6. Use a Notification Service to send notifications to users for event invitations, updates, and reminders
7. Provide a user-friendly Web/Mobile App for interacting with the calendar system
8. Ensure scalability by horizontally scaling the Calendar Service, partitioning the Event Storage and Attendee Storage, and using caching
9. Optimize performance through indexing, caching frequently accessed data, and efficient loading techniques in the user interface
10. Achieve eventual consistency for event updates and attendee responses, while enforcing strong consistency for critical data
11. Design for high availability by deploying multiple service instances, using data replication and failover mechanisms, and implementing load balancing and monitoring

The key insights are to use a combination of relational and non-relational databases for storing different types of data, design a scalable architecture with separate services for calendar management and notifications, optimize performance through indexing and caching, ensure data consistency based on the criticality of operations, and design for high availability through redundancy, replication, and monitoring.
