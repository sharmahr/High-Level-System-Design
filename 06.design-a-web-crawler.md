Here is my solution to designing a web crawler:

**Step 1: Clarify Requirements and Assumptions**

- The web crawler should be able to crawl a large number of web pages efficiently
- It should follow links on the pages it crawls to discover new pages
- It should avoid getting stuck in infinite loops or crawling the same pages repeatedly
- It should respect the robots.txt file and other crawling conventions
- It should be able to handle various types of content (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.)
- It should be scalable and able to handle a high throughput of pages
- Assume the crawler is for a general purpose search engine (not focused on a specific domain)
- Assume the crawler should be able to handle hundreds of billions of web pages

**Step 2: Back of the Envelope Estimations**

- Assume we need to crawl 100 billion web pages
- Average web page size: 500 KB
- Total storage required: 100 billion * 500 KB = 50 PB
- Assume we want to crawl the entire web in 4 weeks
- Required crawling rate: 100 billion / (4 weeks * 7 days/week * 86400 seconds/day) ≈ 400,000 pages/second

**Step 3: High-Level Architecture**

API Design:
- Not applicable for a web crawler (it doesn't expose an API)

Data Model:
- URL: The URL of the web page
- Content: The HTML content of the web page
- Links: The list of outgoing links from the web page
- Metadata: Additional metadata about the web page (e.g., crawl timestamp, content type, size, etc.)

Database:
- A relational database is not suitable due to the large scale and unstructured nature of the data
- A non-relational database like HBase or Cassandra is more appropriate
- The database should be able to handle a high write throughput for storing crawled pages
- It should also support efficient key-based lookups for checking if a URL has already been crawled

High-Level Design:

Key Components:
- URL Frontier: Maintains a list of URLs to be crawled, prioritizes them based on certain criteria
- Crawler Worker: Downloads the web page content from the given URL
- Link Extractor: Extracts outgoing links from the downloaded web page content
- Content Parser: Parses the downloaded web page content and extracts relevant information
- Duplicate Detector: Checks if a URL has already been crawled to avoid redundant work
- Scheduler: Coordinates the different components and manages the overall crawling process

**Step 4: Detailed Design**

URL Frontier:
- Maintains a priority queue of URLs to be crawled
- Prioritizes URLs based on factors like PageRank, last crawl time, change frequency, etc.
- Supports efficient insertion and retrieval of URLs

Crawler Worker:
- Downloads the web page content from the given URL using HTTP requests
- Handles various types of content (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.)
- Respects the robots.txt file and other crawling conventions
- Follows redirects and handles errors gracefully

Link Extractor:
- Parses the downloaded HTML content and extracts outgoing links
- Handles relative and absolute URLs, anchors, etc.
- Filters out invalid or unwanted URLs (e.g., mailto links, URLs with unsupported schemes)

Content Parser:
- Parses the downloaded web page content and extracts relevant information
- Extracts text content, headings, metadata, etc.
- Handles various content formats (HTML, PDF, DOC, etc.) using appropriate parsers

Duplicate Detector:
- Efficiently checks if a URL has already been crawled
- Uses a bloom filter or a distributed key-value store for fast lookups
- Helps avoid redundant work and saves storage space

Scheduler:
- Coordinates the different components and manages the overall crawling process
- Assigns URLs from the URL frontier to the crawler workers
- Monitors the progress and status of the crawler workers
- Handles failures and retries, and ensures fault tolerance

**Step 5: Scalability, Performance, Consistency, Availability**

Scalability:
- **The system can be scaled horizontally by adding more crawler workers**
- **The URL frontier and duplicate detector can be distributed across multiple nodes**
- The database can be sharded based on the URL to distribute the storage and access load

Performance:
- **Prioritizing the URLs in the URL frontier can help crawl important pages faster**
- **Parsing and extracting links can be done in parallel to improve throughput**
- **Bloom filters or distributed key-value stores can provide fast lookups for duplicate detection**
- Caching frequently accessed data can help reduce the load on the backend systems

Consistency:
- **Eventual consistency is acceptable for the web crawling use case**
- **The system should tolerate some level of inconsistency, such as temporary duplicate crawling**
- Strong consistency is not required, as the web is constantly changing anyway

Availability:
- **The system should be designed to handle failures gracefully**
- **Crawler workers should be able to recover from failures and resume crawling from the last checkpoint**
- **The URL frontier and duplicate detector should be replicated to ensure high availability**
- The scheduler should monitor the health of the components and handle failures appropriately

**Summary of Key Points**

To design a scalable and efficient web crawler:

1. Use a **non-relational database** like HBase or Cassandra to store the crawled web pages
2. Use a **priority queue** for the URL frontier to prioritize important pages
3. Use **crawler workers** to download web page content in parallel
4. Use a **link extractor** to parse HTML and extract outgoing links
5. Use a **content parser** to extract relevant information from the downloaded pages
6. Use a **duplicate detector** (e.g., bloom filter, distributed key-value store) to avoid redundant crawling
7. Use a **scheduler** to coordinate the components and manage the crawling process
8. **Scale horizontally** by adding more crawler workers and distributing the URL frontier and duplicate detector
9. Ensure **fault tolerance** by designing the system to handle failures gracefully
10. Accept **eventual consistency** and tolerate some level of temporary inconsistency

The key insights are to use a non-relational database for scalability, prioritize URLs for efficient crawling, parallelize the crawling process, use a duplicate detector for avoiding redundant work, and design the system for fault tolerance and eventual consistency.
