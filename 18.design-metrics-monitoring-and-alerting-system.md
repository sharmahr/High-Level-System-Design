Here is my solution to designing a distributed metrics monitoring and alerting system without using off-the-shelf components:

**Step 1: Clarify Requirements and Assumptions**

- The system should collect metrics from various sources, such as servers, applications, and services
- Metrics can include CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, network traffic, error rates, etc.
- The system should support different types of metrics, such as gauges, counters, and timers
- The system should allow for configuring thresholds and alerts based on metrics values
- Alerts should be triggered when metrics exceed or fall below specified thresholds
- The system should support different alerting channels, such as email, SMS, and webhooks
- The system should provide a dashboard for visualizing metrics and alerting history
- The system should be scalable to handle a large number of metrics and alerts
- The system should be highly available and fault-tolerant
- Assume the system needs to handle 100,000 metrics per second
- Assume the system needs to support 1,000 concurrent users accessing the dashboard

**Step 2: Back of the Envelope Estimations**

- Number of metrics per second: 100,000
- Assuming each metric data point is 100 bytes, total data ingested per second: 100,000 * 100 bytes = 10 MB/s
- Assuming metrics are collected every 10 seconds, total data points per day: 100,000 * 86,400 / 10 = 864 million
- Assuming each data point is stored for 30 days, total storage required: 864 million * 100 bytes * 30 days = 2.6 TB
- Assuming 1,000 concurrent users accessing the dashboard, with each user making 10 requests per minute: 1,000 * 10 * 60 = 600,000 requests per hour

**Step 3: High-Level Architecture**

API Design:
- `collectMetric(metricName, value, timestamp)`: Collects a metric data point
- `configureAlert(alertName, metricName, threshold, comparison, duration)`: Configures an alert based on a metric threshold
- `getMetricData(metricName, startTime, endTime, granularity)`: Retrieves metric data for a specified time range and granularity
- `getAlertHistory(alertName, startTime, endTime)`: Retrieves the history of alerts triggered for a specified time range

Data Model:
- Metric:
  - metricName (unique name of the metric)
  - value (numeric value of the metric)
  - timestamp (timestamp when the metric was collected)
  - tags (optional tags for categorizing metrics)
- Alert:
  - alertName (unique name of the alert)
  - metricName (name of the metric associated with the alert)
  - threshold (threshold value for triggering the alert)
  - comparison (comparison operator, e.g., greater than, less than)
  - duration (duration for which the threshold should be exceeded/breached)
  - alertChannels (channels for sending alerts, e.g., email, SMS)

Database:
- A time-series database like InfluxDB or TimescaleDB can be used to store metrics data
- The time-series database should support high write throughput and efficient querying of metrics data based on time ranges
- A relational database like PostgreSQL can be used to store alert configurations and alert history
- The relational database should support efficient querying of alert configurations and alert history
- A caching layer like Redis can be used to cache frequently accessed metrics data and alert configurations

High-Level Design:

Key Components:
- Metric Collectors: Collect metrics from various sources and send them to the Metrics Ingestion component
- Metrics Ingestion: Receives metrics from collectors and ingests them into the Time-series Database
- Time-series Database: Stores metrics data in a time-series format for efficient querying and analysis
- Alerting Engine: Monitors metrics data and triggers alerts based on configured thresholds
- Relational Database: Stores alert configurations and alert history
- Dashboard: Provides a user interface for visualizing metrics data and alerting history
- Alerting Channels: Sends alerts to specified channels, such as email, SMS, or webhooks
- Caching Layer: Caches frequently accessed metrics data and alert configurations for improved performance

**Step 4: Detailed Design**

Metrics Collection:
- Metric Collectors are deployed on various sources (servers, applications, services) to collect metrics
- Collectors can be implemented as lightweight agents or daemons running on the source systems
- Collectors gather metrics at a specified interval (e.g., every 10 seconds) and send them to the Metrics Ingestion component
- Collectors can batch metrics to reduce network overhead and improve efficiency
- Collectors can also perform local aggregation or filtering of metrics before sending them

Metrics Ingestion:
- The Metrics Ingestion component receives metrics from collectors and validates them
- It performs any necessary transformations or normalizations on the metrics data
- It ingests the metrics into the Time-series Database for storage and querying
- The Metrics Ingestion component can be scaled horizontally to handle high throughput of metrics
- It can also buffer metrics in case of temporary failures or slowdowns in the Time-series Database

Alerting:
- The Alerting Engine continuously monitors metrics data stored in the Time-series Database
- It evaluates the metrics against configured alert thresholds and triggers alerts when conditions are met
- Alerts are stored in the Relational Database along with their corresponding configurations
- The Alerting Engine can be scaled horizontally to handle a large number of alerts
- Alerts are sent to the specified Alerting Channels, such as email, SMS, or webhooks
- The Alerting Engine can also perform deduplication and grouping of alerts to reduce noise

Dashboard:
- The Dashboard provides a user interface for visualizing metrics data and alerting history
- It retrieves metrics data from the Time-series Database and alert history from the Relational Database
- The Dashboard supports various visualization types, such as line graphs, bar charts, and heatmaps
- It allows users to filter and slice metrics data based on time ranges, tags, and other dimensions
- The Dashboard can be optimized for performance by caching frequently accessed metrics data and alert configurations

**Step 5: Scalability, Performance, Consistency, Availability**

Scalability:
- **The system can be scaled horizontally by adding more Metric Collectors, Metrics Ingestion instances, and Time-series Database nodes**
- **The Time-series Database can be partitioned based on the metric name or tags to distribute the data across multiple nodes**
- **The Alerting Engine can be scaled horizontally to handle a large number of alerts**
- **The Dashboard can be served by multiple instances behind a load balancer to handle high user traffic**

Performance:
- **The Time-series Database is optimized for high write throughput and efficient querying of metrics data based on time ranges**
- **The Relational Database is designed for efficient querying of alert configurations and alert history**
- **Caching frequently accessed metrics data and alert configurations in the Caching Layer helps improve read performance**
- **Batching and compression techniques can be used to reduce network overhead and improve data ingestion performance**

Consistency:
- **The Time-series Database provides eventual consistency for metrics data, allowing for high write throughput**
- **The Relational Database ensures strong consistency for alert configurations and alert history**
- **The Alerting Engine can handle duplicate or out-of-order metrics by using techniques like deduplication and windowing**
- **The Dashboard can tolerate eventual consistency for metrics data, as it is primarily used for visualization and analysis**

Availability:
- **The system is designed for high availability by deploying multiple instances of each component**
- **The Time-series Database and Relational Database can be replicated and distributed across multiple nodes for fault tolerance**
- **The Alerting Engine can be designed with failover mechanisms to ensure alerts are always triggered and delivered**
- **The Dashboard can be served by multiple instances behind a load balancer to ensure availability even if some instances fail**

**Summary of Key Points**

To design a scalable and reliable distributed metrics monitoring and alerting system without using off-the-shelf components:

1. Use **Metric Collectors** to gather metrics from various sources and send them to the Metrics Ingestion component
2. Design a **Metrics Ingestion** component to receive metrics, perform validations and transformations, and ingest them into the Time-series Database
3. Choose a **Time-series Database** optimized for high write throughput and efficient querying of metrics data based on time ranges
4. Implement an **Alerting Engine** to continuously monitor metrics data and trigger alerts based on configured thresholds
5. Use a **Relational Database** to store alert configurations and alert history for efficient querying
6. Provide a **Dashboard** for visualizing metrics data and alerting history, with support for filtering and slicing data
7. Set up **Alerting Channels** to send alerts to specified destinations, such as email, SMS, or webhooks
8. Employ a **Caching Layer** to cache frequently accessed metrics data and alert configurations for improved performance
9. Design the system for **horizontal scalability** by allowing components to be scaled independently based on the workload
10. Ensure **high availability** through replication, distribution, and failover mechanisms for critical components

The key insights are to use a Time-series Database for storing and querying metrics data efficiently, design a scalable Metrics Ingestion component to handle high throughput of metrics, implement an Alerting Engine to monitor metrics and trigger alerts based on thresholds, provide a user-friendly Dashboard for visualization and analysis, and ensure high availability and fault tolerance through replication and failover mechanisms.
