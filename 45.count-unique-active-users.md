Here is my solution to designing a service to count the number of unique active users:

**Step 1: Clarify Requirements and Assumptions**

- The service should count the number of unique active users within a specified time period (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)
- A user is considered active if they have performed a specific action or set of actions within the given time period
- The service should handle a large number of user events and provide accurate counts
- The service should be scalable to handle an increasing number of users and events
- The service should be able to handle event data from multiple sources or platforms
- Assume the system needs to handle 10 million daily active users
- Assume an average of 100 events per user per day

**Step 2: Back of the Envelope Estimations**

- Number of daily active users: 10 million
- Average events per user per day: 100
- Total events per day: 10 million * 100 = 1 billion
- Assuming each event data is 100 bytes, total data per day: 1 billion * 100 bytes ≈ 100 GB
- Assuming a 30-day retention period for event data, total storage: 30 * 100 GB = 3 TB

**Step 3: High-Level Architecture**

API Design:
- `recordUserEvent(userId, eventType, timestamp)`: Records a user event with the specified event type and timestamp
- `getUniqueActiveUserCount(startTime, endTime)`: Retrieves the count of unique active users within the specified time range

Data Model:
- UserEvent:
  - userId (identifier of the user)
  - eventType (type of the event, e.g., login, purchase, comment)
  - timestamp (timestamp of the event)
  - ...

Database:
- A non-relational database (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB) can be used to store the user event data
- The database should be optimized for high write throughput and efficient time-based queries
- The database should be horizontally scalable to handle large volumes of event data

High-Level Design:

Key Components:
- API Gateway: Receives user event data from various event sources and routes it to the Event Collector
- Event Collector: Collects and processes the user event data before storing it in the Event Database
- Event Database: Stores the user event data for efficient querying and analysis
- Count Service: Performs the unique active user count calculation based on the specified time range
- Bitmap and HLL: Data structures used by the Count Service for efficient unique user counting
- Cache: Stores frequently accessed or pre-computed unique active user counts for faster retrieval

**Step 4: Detailed Design**

Event Data Collection:
1. User events are generated from various sources, such as web servers, mobile apps, or other platforms
2. The event data is sent to the API Gateway, which routes it to the Event Collector
3. The Event Collector validates and preprocesses the event data, such as removing duplicates or applying data transformations
4. The processed event data is then stored in the Event Database

Unique Active User Count Calculation:
1. The Count Service receives a request to calculate the unique active user count for a specified time range
2. The Count Service retrieves the relevant user event data from the Event Database based on the time range
3. The Count Service uses probabilistic data structures like Bitmap or HyperLogLog (HLL) to efficiently count the unique users
   - Bitmap: A bit array where each bit represents a user, and the bit is set to 1 if the user is active within the time range
   - HyperLogLog: A probabilistic algorithm that estimates the number of unique users based on hash values of user IDs
4. The Count Service returns the calculated unique active user count

Caching:
1. Frequently accessed or pre-computed unique active user counts can be stored in a cache (e.g., Redis) for faster retrieval
2. The Count Service checks the cache before performing the calculation, and if the count is available in the cache, it is returned directly
3. If the count is not available in the cache, the Count Service calculates it and stores the result in the cache for future requests

Data Partitioning and Sharding:
1. To handle large volumes of event data, the Event Database can be partitioned based on time (e.g., daily or hourly partitions)
2. Each partition can be further sharded across multiple database nodes to distribute the data and processing load
3. The Count Service can query the relevant partitions and shards based on the specified time range to calculate the unique active user count

**Step 5: Scalability, Performance, Consistency, Availability**

Scalability:
- **The system can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances of the Event Collector and Count Service to handle increased load**
- **The Event Database can be partitioned and sharded to distribute the data across multiple nodes and handle large volumes of event data**
- **The Cache can be distributed across multiple nodes to handle high read throughput and reduce the load on the Count Service**

Performance:
- **The use of probabilistic data structures like Bitmap and HyperLogLog allows for efficient counting of unique users with low memory footprint**
- **Caching frequently accessed or pre-computed counts improves the response time of the Count Service**
- **Partitioning and sharding the Event Database enables parallel processing and faster querying of event data**

Consistency:
- **The system provides eventual consistency for the unique active user count, as the count may not include the most recent events due to processing delays**
- **The Count Service can use techniques like time-based windowing or watermarking to handle late-arriving events and provide consistent counts**

Availability:
- **The system should be designed for high availability by deploying multiple instances of the Event Collector, Count Service, and Cache across different availability zones**
- **The Event Database should be replicated and have automatic failover mechanisms to ensure data durability and availability**
- **Load balancers can distribute the traffic evenly across the instances to handle failures and ensure continuous service**

**Summary of Key Points**

To design a service to count the number of unique active users:

1. Use a **non-relational database** (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB) to store user event data for high write throughput and efficient time-based queries
2. Implement an **API Gateway** to receive user event data from various sources and route it to the Event Collector
3. Design an **Event Collector** to collect, preprocess, and store user event data in the Event Database
4. Develop a **Count Service** to calculate the unique active user count based on the specified time range
5. Utilize **probabilistic data structures** like Bitmap and HyperLogLog for efficient unique user counting
6. Employ **caching** to store frequently accessed or pre-computed counts for faster retrieval
7. Ensure **scalability** by horizontally scaling the Event Collector, Count Service, and Cache, and sharding the Event Database
8. Optimize **performance** through the use of probabilistic data structures, caching, and parallel processing
9. Provide **eventual consistency** for the unique active user count and handle late-arriving events
10. Design for **high availability** through redundancy, replication, and automatic failover mechanisms

The key insights are to use a non-relational database for storing high-volume event data, utilize probabilistic data structures for efficient unique user counting, employ caching for faster retrieval of counts, ensure scalability through horizontal scaling and sharding, optimize performance through parallel processing, provide eventual consistency while handling late-arriving events, and design for high availability through redundancy and failover mechanisms.
