Here is my solution to designing Google Sheets:

**Step 1: Clarify Requirements and Assumptions**

- The system should allow users to create, view, edit, and collaborate on spreadsheets in real-time
- Spreadsheets should support common features like cells, rows, columns, formulas, and formatting
- Users should be able to import and export spreadsheets in various formats (e.g., CSV, Excel)
- The system should support concurrent editing by multiple users on the same spreadsheet
- Changes made by one user should be visible to other collaborators in real-time
- The system should provide version history and the ability to revert to previous versions
- The system should handle a large number of users and spreadsheets with low latency
- Assume the system needs to support 100 million users
- Assume an average of 100 spreadsheets per user
- Assume an average spreadsheet size of 1 MB

**Step 2: Back of the Envelope Estimations**

- Number of users: 100 million
- Average spreadsheets per user: 100
- Total number of spreadsheets: 100 million * 100 = 10 billion
- Average spreadsheet size: 1 MB
- Total storage required: 10 billion * 1 MB ≈ 10 PB
- Assuming 10% of users are active at any given time, concurrent users: 100 million * 0.1 = 10 million
- Assuming each user makes an average of 10 edits per spreadsheet per day, total edits per day: 100 million * 100 * 10 = 100 billion

**Step 3: High-Level Architecture**

API Design:
- `createSpreadsheet(userId, title)`: Creates a new spreadsheet for the user
- `getSpreadsheet(spreadsheetId)`: Retrieves a spreadsheet by its ID
- `updateCell(spreadsheetId, rowIndex, columnIndex, value)`: Updates the value of a cell in the spreadsheet
- `getCell(spreadsheetId, rowIndex, columnIndex)`: Retrieves the value of a cell in the spreadsheet
- `addCollaborator(spreadsheetId, userId)`: Adds a collaborator to the spreadsheet
- `removeCollaborator(spreadsheetId, userId)`: Removes a collaborator from the spreadsheet
- `getCollaborators(spreadsheetId)`: Retrieves the list of collaborators for a spreadsheet

Data Model:
- User:
  - userId (unique identifier)
  - email
  - name
  - ...
- Spreadsheet:
  - spreadsheetId (unique identifier)
  - title
  - createdBy (user who created the spreadsheet)
  - createdAt
  - lastModifiedAt
  - ...
- Cell:
  - cellId (unique identifier)
  - spreadsheetId (foreign key to Spreadsheet)
  - rowIndex
  - columnIndex
  - value
  - ...
- Collaborator:
  - collaboratorId (unique identifier)
  - spreadsheetId (foreign key to Spreadsheet)
  - userId (foreign key to User)
  - role (e.g., viewer, editor)
  - ...

Database:
- A combination of relational and non-relational databases can be used
- User and Spreadsheet metadata can be stored in a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for structured data and efficient querying
- Cell data can be stored in a non-relational database (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Google Bigtable) for scalability and high write throughput
- Collaborator data can be stored in a relational database for efficient querying and access control

Key Components:
- API Gateway: Handles incoming requests from clients, performs authentication and authorization, and routes requests to the appropriate services
- Spreadsheet Service: Manages the creation, retrieval, and updating of spreadsheets and cells
- Cell Storage: Stores the cell data of spreadsheets in a non-relational database for scalability and high write throughput
- Collaboration Service: Handles real-time collaboration features, such as concurrent editing and synchronization of changes
- Collaborator Storage: Stores collaborator information and access control for spreadsheets
- Version History: Manages the version history of spreadsheets and allows reverting to previous versions
- Web Client: Provides the user interface for interacting with spreadsheets, including editing cells, applying formatting, and collaborating with others

**Step 4: Detailed Design**

Real-time Collaboration:
1. When a user makes changes to a cell in a spreadsheet, the Web Client sends the changes to the Spreadsheet Service via the API Gateway
2. The Spreadsheet Service validates the changes and updates the corresponding cell in the Cell Storage
3. The Collaboration Service broadcasts the changes to all other collaborators currently editing the same spreadsheet
4. The Web Clients of the collaborators receive the changes and update their local copies of the spreadsheet in real-time
5. Conflict resolution techniques, such as operational transformation or CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types), can be used to handle concurrent edits and ensure consistency

Spreadsheet Versioning:
1. When a user makes significant changes to a spreadsheet (e.g., multiple cell updates), the Spreadsheet Service creates a new version of the spreadsheet
2. The previous version of the spreadsheet is stored in the Version History storage
3. Users can view the version history of a spreadsheet and revert to previous versions if needed

Collaborator Management:
1. When a user adds a collaborator to a spreadsheet, the Spreadsheet Service creates a new entry in the Collaborator Storage with the specified access role (e.g., viewer, editor)
2. When a collaborator accesses the spreadsheet, the Spreadsheet Service checks the Collaborator Storage to determine their access rights and permissions
3. Collaborators can be removed from a spreadsheet by deleting their entry from the Collaborator Storage

Scalability and Performance:
1. The Cell Storage can be partitioned based on the spreadsheet ID to distribute the data across multiple nodes and handle high write throughput
2. Caching can be used to store frequently accessed spreadsheet metadata and cell data to reduce the load on the databases
3. The Collaboration Service can be scaled horizontally to handle a large number of concurrent collaborations
4. Techniques like lazy loading and incremental updates can be used to optimize the performance of the Web Client when loading large spreadsheets

**Step 5: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance**

Consistency:
- Strong consistency can be ensured for spreadsheet metadata and collaborator information stored in the relational database
- Eventual consistency can be accepted for cell data stored in the non-relational database, as real-time collaboration requires low latency and high availability
- Conflict resolution techniques, such as operational transformation or CRDTs, can be used to handle concurrent edits and ensure eventual consistency

Availability:
- The system should be highly available to ensure uninterrupted access to spreadsheets for users
- The Spreadsheet Service and Collaboration Service can be deployed across multiple regions or availability zones to ensure high availability
- The Cell Storage and Collaborator Storage should be replicated across multiple nodes to prevent data loss and ensure availability in case of node failures

Partition Tolerance:
- The system should be designed to handle network partitions and continue functioning even if some components become unreachable
- The Spreadsheet Service and Collaboration Service should be able to handle temporary network partitions and synchronize changes once the partition is resolved
- The Cell Storage and Collaborator Storage should be distributed across multiple nodes and data centers to minimize the impact of network partitions

**Step 6: Scalability and Performance**

Scalability:
- The system should be horizontally scalable to handle a growing number of users and spreadsheets
- The Spreadsheet Service and Collaboration Service can be scaled out by adding more instances behind a load balancer
- The Cell Storage can be partitioned based on the spreadsheet ID to distribute the data across multiple nodes and handle high write throughput
- The Collaborator Storage can be sharded based on the user ID to distribute the data and handle a large number of collaborators

Performance:
- Caching can be used to store frequently accessed spreadsheet metadata and cell data to reduce the load on the databases and improve read performance
- Techniques like lazy loading and incremental updates can be used to optimize the performance of the Web Client when loading large spreadsheets
- The Collaboration Service can use efficient algorithms and data structures to handle real-time collaboration and minimize latency
- Indexing can be used in the Cell Storage and Collaborator Storage to enable fast querying and retrieval of data

**Summary of Key Points**

To design Google Sheets, consider the following key points:

1. Use a combination of relational and non-relational databases to store structured data (User, Spreadsheet metadata) and high-volume data (Cell data)
2. Implement an API Gateway to handle incoming requests, perform authentication and authorization, and route requests to the appropriate services
3. Design a Spreadsheet Service to manage the creation, retrieval, and updating of spreadsheets and cells
4. Utilize a non-relational database (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Google Bigtable) for the Cell Storage to handle high write throughput and scalability
5. Implement a Collaboration Service to handle real-time collaboration features, such as concurrent editing and synchronization of changes
6. Use a relational database for the Collaborator Storage to store collaborator information and access control
7. Implement a Version History component to manage the version history of spreadsheets and allow reverting to previous versions
8. Ensure strong consistency for spreadsheet metadata and collaborator information, while accepting eventual consistency for cell data
9. Design the system for high availability by deploying services across multiple regions or availability zones and replicating data across multiple nodes
10. Handle network partitions and ensure partition tolerance by designing the system to continue functioning even if some components become unreachable
11. Scale the system horizontally by adding more instances of the Spreadsheet Service and Collaboration Service behind a load balancer
12. Optimize performance through caching, lazy loading, incremental updates, and efficient algorithms for real-time collaboration
