Here is my solution to designing a digital wallet service:

**Step 1: Clarify Requirements and Assumptions**

- The digital wallet service should allow users to store and manage various payment methods, such as credit cards, debit cards, and bank accounts
- Users should be able to add, remove, and update their payment methods securely
- The service should support fund transfers between users and merchants
- The service should provide a secure and user-friendly interface for making payments online and in-store
- The service should integrate with various payment gateways and financial institutions
- The service should comply with relevant financial regulations and security standards
- The service should provide transaction history and reporting features for users
- The service should handle different currencies and support currency conversions
- Assume the service needs to support 50 million users
- Assume an average of 10 transactions per user per month

**Step 2: Back of the Envelope Estimations**

- Number of users: 50 million
- Average transactions per user per month: 10
- Total transactions per month: 50 million * 10 = 500 million
- Assuming an average transaction amount of $50, total transaction volume per month: 500 million * $50 = $25 billion
- Assuming each user has an average of 3 payment methods, total payment methods: 50 million * 3 = 150 million
- Assuming each transaction record is 1 KB and stored for 5 years, total storage: 500 million * 1 KB * 12 months * 5 years ≈ 30 TB

**Step 3: High-Level Architecture**

API Design:
- `addPaymentMethod(userId, paymentMethodType, paymentMethodData)`: Adds a new payment method for a user
- `removePaymentMethod(userId, paymentMethodId)`: Removes a payment method for a user
- `updatePaymentMethod(userId, paymentMethodId, updatedData)`: Updates a payment method for a user
- `getPaymentMethods(userId)`: Retrieves all payment methods for a user
- `makePayment(userId, paymentMethodId, amount, currency, recipient)`: Initiates a payment transaction
- `getTransactionHistory(userId, startDate, endDate)`: Retrieves transaction history for a user

Data Model:
- User:
  - userId (unique identifier for the user)
  - email
  - name
  - password (hashed)
  - ...
- PaymentMethod:
  - paymentMethodId (unique identifier for the payment method)
  - userId (foreign key to User)
  - type (credit card, debit card, bank account)
  - cardNumber (encrypted)
  - expirationDate (encrypted)
  - cardholderName (encrypted)
  - ...
- Transaction:
  - transactionId (unique identifier for the transaction)
  - userId (foreign key to User)
  - paymentMethodId (foreign key to PaymentMethod)
  - amount
  - currency
  - recipient
  - status (pending, success, failed)
  - timestamp
  - ...

Database:
- A combination of relational and non-relational databases can be used
- User and PaymentMethod data can be stored in a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL for structured data and efficient querying
- Transaction data can be stored in a non-relational database like MongoDB or Cassandra for scalability and high write throughput
- Sensitive data, such as payment method details, should be encrypted and stored securely
- Database sharding can be applied based on userId to distribute the data across multiple database instances

High-Level Design:

Key Components:
- API Gateway: Acts as the entry point for client requests and handles request routing, authentication, and authorization
- Payment Processor: Handles the processing of payment transactions, including communication with payment gateways and financial institutions
- Authentication & Authorization: Manages user authentication and authorization for accessing the digital wallet service
- Payment Method Vault: Securely stores and manages user payment methods, including encryption and tokenization
- User Database: Stores user information and payment method metadata
- Transaction Database: Stores transaction data and history

**Step 4: Detailed Design**

Adding a Payment Method:
1. The user makes a request to add a payment method through the API Gateway
2. The API Gateway authenticates the user and forwards the request to the Payment Method Vault
3. The Payment Method Vault validates the payment method data and securely stores the encrypted payment method details
4. The Payment Method Vault returns a payment method token to the API Gateway
5. The API Gateway stores the payment method token and metadata in the User Database
6. The API Gateway sends a response to the user confirming the successful addition of the payment method

Making a Payment:
1. The user initiates a payment request through the API Gateway, specifying the payment method, amount, currency, and recipient
2. The API Gateway authenticates the user and forwards the request to the Payment Processor
3. The Payment Processor retrieves the payment method details from the Payment Method Vault using the provided payment method token
4. The Payment Processor communicates with the relevant payment gateway or financial institution to process the payment transaction
5. Upon successful payment processing, the Payment Processor records the transaction details in the Transaction Database
6. The Payment Processor sends a response to the API Gateway indicating the payment status
7. The API Gateway forwards the response to the user, confirming the payment status

Retrieving Transaction History:
1. The user makes a request to retrieve their transaction history through the API Gateway
2. The API Gateway authenticates the user and forwards the request to the Transaction Database
3. The Transaction Database queries the user's transaction records based on the specified date range
4. The Transaction Database returns the transaction history data to the API Gateway
5. The API Gateway formats the data and sends the transaction history response to the user

**Step 5: Scalability, Performance, Consistency, Availability**

Scalability:
- **The API Gateway can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances to handle increased traffic**
- **The Payment Processor can be scaled independently to handle a higher volume of payment transactions**
- **The User Database and Transaction Database can be sharded based on userId to distribute the data across multiple database instances**
- **Caching can be implemented at the API Gateway and Payment Processor levels to reduce the load on the databases**

Performance:
- **The API Gateway should efficiently route requests to the appropriate components to minimize latency**
- **The Payment Processor should optimize communication with payment gateways and financial institutions to ensure fast transaction processing**
- **Caching frequently accessed data, such as payment method tokens and user information, can improve response times**
- **Asynchronous processing can be utilized for non-critical tasks, such as updating transaction history and generating reports**

Consistency:
- **The User Database and Payment Method Vault should maintain strong consistency to ensure accurate user and payment method information**
- **The Transaction Database can afford eventual consistency for transaction history and reporting purposes**
- **Atomic operations and transactions should be used when updating critical data, such as payment method details and transaction status**

Availability:
- **The API Gateway and Payment Processor should be deployed across multiple availability zones or regions to ensure high availability**
- **The databases should have replication and failover mechanisms to prevent data loss and minimize downtime**
- **Circuit breakers and retry mechanisms should be implemented to handle temporary failures and network issues when communicating with external services**
- **Regular backups should be performed to enable quick recovery in case of data corruption or system failures**

**Summary of Key Points**

To design a digital wallet service:

1. Use a combination of **relational and non-relational databases** to store user data, payment methods, and transaction history
2. Implement an **API Gateway** to handle client requests, authentication, and authorization
3. Develop a **Payment Processor** to handle payment transaction processing and communication with payment gateways and financial institutions
4. Utilize a **Payment Method Vault** to securely store and manage user payment methods, including encryption and tokenization
5. Design an **Authentication & Authorization** component to manage user access to the digital wallet service
6. Store user information and payment method metadata in a **User Database**
7. Store transaction data and history in a **Transaction Database**
8. Ensure **scalability** by designing the system for horizontal scaling of the API Gateway, Payment Processor, and databases
9. Optimize **performance** through efficient request routing, caching, and asynchronous processing
10. Maintain **strong consistency** for critical data, such as user information and payment methods, while allowing eventual consistency for transaction history
11. Design for **high availability** by deploying components across multiple availability zones or regions and implementing replication, failover, and backup mechanisms

The key insights are to use a combination of relational and non-relational databases to handle different data types and access patterns, implement an API Gateway for request handling and authentication, develop a Payment Processor for transaction processing, utilize a Payment Method Vault for secure storage of payment methods, and ensure scalability, performance, consistency, and availability through appropriate design decisions.
