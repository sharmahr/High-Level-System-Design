Here is my solution to designing a video chat service like Zoom:

**Step 1: Clarify Requirements and Assumptions**

- Users should be able to create and join video chat rooms
- The system should support multiple participants in a single video chat room
- Participants should be able to see and hear each other in real-time
- The system should support video and audio transmission, along with screen sharing
- The system should handle varying network conditions and adapt video/audio quality accordingly
- The system should ensure secure communication and protect user privacy
- Assume the system needs to support 10 million daily active users
- Assume an average of 1 million concurrent video chat rooms during peak hours
- Assume an average of 5 participants per video chat room

**Step 2: Back of the Envelope Estimations**

- Number of daily active users: 10 million
- Average concurrent video chat rooms during peak hours: 1 million
- Average participants per video chat room: 5
- Total concurrent participants during peak hours: 1 million * 5 = 5 million
- Assuming an average video bitrate of 1 Mbps per participant, total bandwidth required: 5 million * 1 Mbps = 5 Tbps
- Assuming an average audio bitrate of 64 Kbps per participant, total bandwidth required: 5 million * 64 Kbps = 320 Gbps

**Step 3: High-Level Architecture**

API Design:
- `createRoom(userId, roomSettings)`: Creates a new video chat room with the specified settings
- `joinRoom(userId, roomId)`: Allows a user to join an existing video chat room
- `leaveRoom(userId, roomId)`: Removes a user from a video chat room
- `getParticipants(roomId)`: Retrieves the list of participants in a video chat room
- `sendMessage(userId, roomId, message)`: Sends a chat message to all participants in a video chat room

Data Model:
- User:
  - userId (unique identifier)
  - name
  - email
  - ...
- Room:
  - roomId (unique identifier)
  - name
  - createdBy (user who created the room)
  - participants (list of user IDs)
  - startTime
  - endTime
  - ...
- Message:
  - messageId (unique identifier)
  - roomId (foreign key to Room)
  - senderId (foreign key to User)
  - content
  - timestamp
  - ...

Database:
- A combination of relational and non-relational databases can be used
- User and Room metadata can be stored in a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for structured data and efficient querying
- Message data can be stored in a non-relational database (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) for scalability and real-time performance

Key Components:
- API Gateway: Handles client requests, performs authentication and authorization, and routes requests to the appropriate services
- Room Service: Manages the creation, joining, and leaving of video chat rooms
- Participant Service: Handles the management of participants in a video chat room, including their video and audio streams
- Media Server: Facilitates the real-time transmission of video and audio data between participants
- Signal Server: Handles signaling and coordination between participants for establishing peer-to-peer connections
- Chat Service: Manages the chat functionality within video chat rooms
- Web Client: Provides the user interface for participating in video chat rooms
- Database: Stores user, room, and chat message metadata

**Step 4: Detailed Design**

Establishing a Video Chat Room:
1. A user creates a new video chat room by sending a request to the Room Service via the API Gateway
2. The Room Service generates a unique room ID and stores the room metadata in the database
3. The Room Service returns the room ID to the user
4. The user shares the room ID with other participants who want to join the video chat room

Joining a Video Chat Room:
1. A participant joins a video chat room by sending a join request to the Room Service via the API Gateway
2. The Room Service validates the room ID and adds the participant to the room's participant list
3. The Participant Service establishes a connection between the participant's Web Client and the Media Server
4. The Media Server facilitates the real-time transmission of video and audio data between the participant and other participants in the room

Real-time Video and Audio Transmission:
1. Participants' Web Clients capture video and audio data from their devices
2. The captured data is sent to the Media Server using WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) protocols
3. The Media Server receives the video and audio data from each participant
4. The Media Server relays the video and audio data to other participants in the room
5. The Media Server adapts the video and audio quality based on network conditions and participant capabilities

Signaling and Coordination:
1. The Signal Server handles the signaling and coordination between participants
2. Participants' Web Clients exchange signaling messages (e.g., offer, answer, ICE candidates) via the Signal Server to establish peer-to-peer connections
3. The Signal Server relays the signaling messages between participants to facilitate the establishment of direct communication channels

Chat Functionality:
1. Participants can send chat messages within a video chat room
2. Chat messages are sent to the Chat Service via the API Gateway
3. The Chat Service stores the chat messages in the database and broadcasts them to all participants in the room
4. Participants' Web Clients receive the chat messages and display them in the chat interface

**Step 5: Scalability, Performance, Consistency, Availability**

Scalability:
- **The system can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances of the Room Service, Participant Service, Media Server, and Signal Server to handle increased load**
- **The database can be sharded based on room ID to distribute the data across multiple nodes**
- **Caching can be used to store frequently accessed room and participant metadata to reduce the load on the database**

Performance:
- **The Media Server should be optimized for low-latency video and audio transmission using WebRTC protocols**
- **The Media Server can adapt the video and audio quality based on network conditions and participant capabilities to ensure smooth streaming**
- **The Signal Server should efficiently handle the exchange of signaling messages between participants to minimize latency in establishing peer-to-peer connections**

Consistency:
- **The system should ensure eventual consistency for room and participant metadata, allowing for quick updates and reads**
- **Strong consistency can be maintained for critical operations, such as creating and joining rooms, to avoid conflicts**

Availability:
- **The system should be designed for high availability by deploying multiple instances of the services across different regions or data centers**
- **Load balancers can distribute the traffic across the available instances to ensure optimal performance and fault tolerance**
- **The database should have replication and failover mechanisms to ensure data durability and availability**

**Summary of Key Points**

To design a video chat service like Zoom:

1. Use a **combination of relational and non-relational databases** to store user, room, and chat message metadata
2. Implement an **API Gateway** to handle client requests, authentication, and authorization
3. Design a **Room Service** to manage the creation, joining, and leaving of video chat rooms
4. Develop a **Participant Service** to handle the management of participants in a video chat room
5. Utilize a **Media Server** to facilitate the real-time transmission of video and audio data between participants
6. Implement a **Signal Server** to handle signaling and coordination between participants for establishing peer-to-peer connections
7. Use a **Chat Service** to manage the chat functionality within video chat rooms
8. Ensure **scalability** by horizontally scaling the services, sharding the database, and using caching
9. Optimize **performance** through low-latency video and audio transmission using WebRTC protocols and efficient signaling
10. Maintain **eventual consistency** for room and participant metadata and ensure strong consistency for critical operations
11. Design for **high availability** by deploying multiple service instances, using load balancers, and ensuring database replication and failover

The key insights are to use a combination of relational and non-relational databases for storing metadata, implement separate services for room management, participant management, media transmission, and signaling, utilize WebRTC protocols for low-latency video and audio streaming, ensure scalability through horizontal scaling and caching, maintain consistency based on the criticality of operations, and design for high availability through redundancy and failover mechanisms.
