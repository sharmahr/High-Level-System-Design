Here is my solution to designing a system for k most searched keywords, k most played songs, or k most played videos:

**Step 1: Clarify Requirements and Assumptions**

- The system should track the most frequently searched keywords, played songs, or played videos over a given time period
- The value of k represents the number of top items to be tracked (e.g., top 10, top 100)
- The system should update the top k items in real-time as new data is received
- The system should be able to handle a high volume of concurrent requests and data updates
- The system should provide low-latency access to the top k items
- Assume the system needs to handle 1 million searches, song plays, or video plays per second
- Assume the total number of unique keywords, songs, or videos is 100 million

**Step 2: Back of the Envelope Estimations**

- Requests per second: 1 million
- Total unique items: 100 million
- Assuming each item ID is 8 bytes and each counter is 4 bytes, total memory for counters: 100 million * (8 bytes + 4 bytes) = 1.2 GB
- Assuming each item ID is 8 bytes and we store the top 100 items, memory for top k items: 100 * 8 bytes = 800 bytes

**Step 3: High-Level Architecture**

API Design:
- `incrementCounter(itemId)`: Increments the counter for a given item (keyword, song, or video)
- `getTopK()`: Retrieves the top k items based on their counters

Data Model:
- Item:
  - itemId (unique identifier)
  - counter (number of occurrences)

Database:
- A non-relational database (e.g., Redis, Cassandra) can be used to store the item counters
- The database should support fast increments and efficient retrieval of top k items

High-Level Design:

```

Key Components:
- API Gateway: Receives client requests, performs request routing, and load balancing
- Counter Service: Handles the increment operations for item counters
- In-Memory Counter Cache: Stores the item counters in memory for fast read and write operations
- Top K Service: Calculates and maintains the top k items based on their counters
- Persistent Storage: Stores the item counters persistently for durability and fault tolerance

**Step 4: Detailed Design**

Counter Service:
1. When a client sends a request to increment the counter for an item, the API Gateway routes the request to the Counter Service
2. The Counter Service performs the increment operation on the corresponding item counter in the In-Memory Counter Cache
3. The Counter Service periodically persists the updated counters to the Persistent Storage for durability

Top K Service:
1. The Top K Service maintains a priority queue or a heap data structure to efficiently track the top k items based on their counters
2. Whenever an item counter is incremented, the Top K Service updates its data structure to reflect the change
3. If the incremented item becomes one of the top k items, it is added to the top k list, and the item with the lowest counter is removed if the list exceeds k items
4. The Top K Service exposes an API endpoint to retrieve the current top k items

Persistence and Fault Tolerance:
1. The Counter Service periodically persists the in-memory counters to the Persistent Storage to ensure durability
2. In case of a failure or restart, the Counter Service can reload the counters from the Persistent Storage to recover its state
3. The Top K Service can also persist its top k list to the Persistent Storage for fault tolerance

**Step 5: Scalability, Performance, Consistency, Availability**

Scalability:
- **The system can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances of the Counter Service to handle increased load**
- **The In-Memory Counter Cache can be distributed across multiple nodes using techniques like consistent hashing to distribute the load**
- **The Top K Service can be scaled independently to handle the calculation and serving of top k items**

Performance:
- **The In-Memory Counter Cache allows for fast increment operations and low-latency access to item counters**
- **The Top K Service maintains the top k items in memory, enabling quick retrieval of the most popular items**
- **The use of a priority queue or heap data structure ensures efficient updates and retrieval of top k items**

Consistency:
- **The system provides eventual consistency for item counters, as the in-memory counters are periodically persisted to the Persistent Storage**
- **The Top K Service maintains a consistent view of the top k items based on the counter updates it receives**

Availability:
- **The system can be designed for high availability by deploying multiple instances of the Counter Service and Top K Service across different availability zones or regions**
- **The In-Memory Counter Cache can be replicated across multiple nodes to ensure data availability in case of node failures**
- **The Persistent Storage can be designed with replication and backup mechanisms to ensure data durability and recovery in case of failures**

**Summary of Key Points**

To design a system for k most searched keywords, k most played songs, or k most played videos:

1. Use a **non-relational database** (e.g., Redis, Cassandra) to store item counters for fast increments and retrieval
2. Implement a **Counter Service** to handle increment operations on item counters
3. Utilize an **In-Memory Counter Cache** to store item counters for fast read and write operations
4. Design a **Top K Service** to calculate and maintain the top k items based on their counters
5. Use a **priority queue or heap data structure** in the Top K Service for efficient updates and retrieval of top k items
6. Ensure **scalability** by allowing horizontal scaling of the Counter Service and distributing the In-Memory Counter Cache
7. Achieve **high performance** through in-memory caching of counters and efficient data structures for top k calculations
8. Provide **eventual consistency** for item counters by periodically persisting in-memory counters to Persistent Storage
9. Ensure **high availability** through deployment of multiple service instances, replication of the In-Memory Counter Cache, and durable Persistent Storage

The key insights are to use a non-relational database for storing item counters, implement a Counter Service for handling increment operations, utilize an In-Memory Counter Cache for fast read and write operations, design a Top K Service with efficient data structures for top k calculations, ensure scalability through horizontal scaling and distribution, achieve high performance through in-memory caching and efficient data structures, provide eventual consistency by periodically persisting counters, and ensure high availability through replication and durable storage.
