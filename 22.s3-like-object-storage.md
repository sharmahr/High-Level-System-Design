Here is my solution to designing an S3-like object storage system:

**Step 1: Clarify Requirements and Assumptions**

- The system should allow users to store and retrieve objects (files) in a scalable and distributed manner
- Objects should be stored with a unique key (identifier) and metadata
- The system should support versioning of objects, allowing users to retrieve previous versions
- Users should be able to access objects using a RESTful API
- The system should provide access control and authentication mechanisms to secure objects
- The system should be highly available and durable, ensuring objects are not lost due to hardware failures
- The system should be able to handle a large number of objects and high read/write throughput
- Assume the system needs to store 100 billion objects
- Assume an average object size of 1 MB
- Assume a read-to-write ratio of 10:1

**Step 2: Back of the Envelope Estimations**

- Total number of objects: 100 billion
- Average object size: 1 MB
- Total storage required: 100 billion * 1 MB = 100 PB
- Assuming a read-to-write ratio of 10:1 and 100 million requests per day:
  - Number of read requests per second: (100 million * 10) / (24 * 60 * 60) ≈ 11,574
  - Number of write requests per second: (100 million * 1) / (24 * 60 * 60) ≈ 1,157

**Step 3: High-Level Architecture**

API Design:
- `putObject(bucketName, objectKey, object, metadata)`: Stores an object with the given key and metadata in the specified bucket
- `getObject(bucketName, objectKey)`: Retrieves the object with the given key from the specified bucket
- `deleteObject(bucketName, objectKey)`: Deletes the object with the given key from the specified bucket
- `listObjects(bucketName, prefix, delimiter, maxKeys)`: Lists objects in the specified bucket with optional prefix, delimiter, and maximum number of keys

Data Model:
- Object:
  - objectKey (unique identifier for the object)
  - bucketName (name of the bucket the object belongs to)
  - data (binary data of the object)
  - metadata (key-value pairs for object metadata)
  - version (version of the object)
  - ...
- Bucket:
  - bucketName (unique name of the bucket)
  - creationDate (timestamp of bucket creation)
  - ...

Database:
- A combination of relational and non-relational databases can be used
- Bucket metadata can be stored in a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL for structured data and efficient querying
- Object metadata can be stored in a distributed key-value store like Apache Cassandra or Amazon DynamoDB for scalability and high read/write throughput
- Object data can be stored in a distributed file system like HDFS or a distributed object storage system like Ceph or OpenStack Swift

High-Level Design:

```

Key Components:
- API Gateway: Handles incoming client requests and routes them to the appropriate components
- Object Controller: Manages the storage and retrieval of objects, handles versioning and access control
- Metadata Store: Stores object and bucket metadata in a distributed key-value store
- Object Storage: Stores the actual object data in a distributed file system or object storage system

**Step 4: Detailed Design**

Storing an Object:
- When a client sends a PUT request to store an object, the API Gateway receives the request
- The API Gateway authenticates the request and routes it to the Object Controller
- The Object Controller performs the following tasks:
  - Validates the request parameters and access permissions
  - Generates a unique identifier (objectKey) for the object
  - Stores the object data in the Object Storage
  - Stores the object metadata (objectKey, bucketName, metadata, version) in the Metadata Store
- The Object Controller returns a success response to the client

Retrieving an Object:
- When a client sends a GET request to retrieve an object, the API Gateway receives the request
- The API Gateway authenticates the request and routes it to the Object Controller
- The Object Controller performs the following tasks:
  - Validates the request parameters and access permissions
  - Retrieves the object metadata from the Metadata Store using the objectKey
  - Retrieves the object data from the Object Storage using the metadata information
- The Object Controller returns the object data and metadata to the client

Object Versioning:
- When an object is stored with the same objectKey as an existing object, the Object Controller creates a new version of the object
- The Object Controller stores the new version of the object data in the Object Storage
- The Object Controller updates the metadata in the Metadata Store to include the version information
- Clients can retrieve specific versions of an object by specifying the version in the request

Access Control and Security:
- The system implements access control mechanisms to secure objects and buckets
- Each bucket and object can have associated access control lists (ACLs) that define the permissions for different users or groups
- The API Gateway authenticates and authorizes client requests based on the ACLs
- The Object Controller enforces the access control rules when storing or retrieving objects

**Step 5: Scalability, Performance, Consistency, Availability**

Scalability:
- **The system can be scaled horizontally by adding more nodes to the Object Storage and Metadata Store clusters**
- **The Object Storage can be distributed across multiple nodes using techniques like consistent hashing or sharding**
- **The Metadata Store can be partitioned and replicated across multiple nodes to handle high read/write throughput**
- **The API Gateway can be scaled horizontally to handle increased client requests**

Performance:
- **The system can achieve high performance by optimizing data placement and retrieval strategies in the Object Storage**
- **Caching can be used at various levels (e.g., API Gateway, Object Controller) to store frequently accessed objects and metadata**
- **The Metadata Store can use in-memory caching and efficient indexing techniques to improve metadata access performance**
- **The system can employ data compression and deduplication techniques to reduce storage overhead and improve data transfer efficiency**

Consistency:
- **The system provides eventual consistency for object storage and retrieval**
- **The Metadata Store can use consistency models like quorum-based consistency or strong consistency for critical metadata operations**
- **Version control mechanisms ensure that clients can retrieve consistent versions of objects**
- **The system can implement techniques like vector clocks or timestamp-based conflict resolution to handle concurrent updates**

Availability:
- **The system should be designed for high availability by replicating data across multiple nodes and data centers**
- **The Object Storage and Metadata Store clusters should have fault-tolerant architectures with automatic failover mechanisms**
- **The API Gateway can be deployed across multiple availability zones to ensure high availability**
- **The system should have monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and resolve any failures or performance issues**

**Summary of Key Points**

To design a scalable and reliable S3-like object storage system:

1. Use a combination of **relational and non-relational databases** to store bucket metadata, object metadata, and object data
2. Implement an **API Gateway** to handle client requests and route them to the appropriate components
3. Develop an **Object Controller** to manage the storage and retrieval of objects, handle versioning, and enforce access control
4. Utilize a **distributed key-value store** (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB) for storing object and bucket metadata
5. Employ a **distributed file system or object storage system** (e.g., HDFS, Ceph, OpenStack Swift) for storing the actual object data
6. Ensure **scalability** by designing the system for horizontal scaling, distributing the Object Storage and Metadata Store across multiple nodes
7. Optimize **performance** through data placement and retrieval strategies, caching, efficient indexing, compression, and deduplication techniques
8. Provide **eventual consistency** for object storage and retrieval, with options for stronger consistency for critical metadata operations
9. Implement **versioning** mechanisms to allow clients to retrieve consistent versions of objects
10. Design for **high availability** by replicating data across multiple nodes and data centers, implementing fault-tolerant architectures, and setting up monitoring and alerting mechanisms

The key insights are to use a combination of relational and non-relational databases to handle different data types and access patterns, implement an API Gateway for request handling and routing, utilize a distributed key-value store for metadata storage, and employ a distributed file system or object storage system for storing object data. Designing the system for scalability, performance, consistency, and availability is crucial to handle a large number of objects and high read/write throughput.
