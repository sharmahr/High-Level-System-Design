Here is my solution to designing an audio recognition system like Shazam:

**Step 1: Clarify Requirements and Assumptions**

- The system should be able to identify a song based on a short audio clip (e.g., 5-10 seconds) recorded by a user
- The system should have a large database of songs to match against
- The song identification process should be fast and accurate
- The system should be able to handle a high volume of concurrent song identification requests
- The system should be scalable to accommodate a growing database of songs and increasing user base
- Assume the system needs to support 100 million registered users
- Assume an average of 1 million song identification requests per day
- Assume a database of 50 million songs

**Step 2: Back of the Envelope Estimations**

- Number of registered users: 100 million
- Average song identification requests per day: 1 million
- Database size: 50 million songs
- Assuming an average song duration of 3 minutes and a bitrate of 128 kbps, storage per song: 3 * 60 * 128 * 1000 / 8 ≈ 2.88 MB
- Total storage for 50 million songs: 50 million * 2.88 MB ≈ 144 TB
- Assuming a 10-second audio clip is used for song identification and a bitrate of 128 kbps, size of each audio clip: 10 * 128 * 1000 / 8 ≈ 160 KB
- Total size of audio clips per day: 1 million * 160 KB ≈ 160 GB

**Step 3: High-Level Architecture**

API Design:
- `identifySong(audioClip)`: Sends an audio clip to the system for song identification
- `getMatchingResult(requestId)`: Retrieves the matching song details for a given song identification request

Data Model:
- Song:
  - songId (unique identifier)
  - title
  - artist
  - album
  - duration
  - fingerprint (unique audio fingerprint)
  - ...
- SongIdentificationRequest:
  - requestId (unique identifier)
  - userId
  - audioClip
  - timestamp
  - status (pending, completed, failed)
  - ...
- User:
  - userId (unique identifier)
  - username
  - email
  - ...

Database:
- A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) can be used to store song metadata and user information
- A non-relational database (e.g., Cassandra, HBase) can be used to store audio fingerprints for efficient matching
- A distributed storage system (e.g., HDFS, S3) can be used to store the actual audio files

Key Components:
- API Gateway: Handles client requests, performs authentication and authorization, and routes requests to the appropriate services
- Song Matching Service: Receives the audio clip, extracts the fingerprint, and matches it against the fingerprints in the database
- Fingerprint Database: Stores the unique audio fingerprints of songs for efficient matching
- Audio Storage: Stores the actual audio files of the songs
- Result Cache: Caches the matching song details to improve response time for frequently requested songs
- Metadata Database: Stores song metadata such as title, artist, album, and duration
- Mobile Client: The user-facing mobile application that records audio clips and sends them for song identification

**Step 4: Detailed Design**

Audio Fingerprinting:
1. When a song is added to the database, the system generates a unique audio fingerprint for the song
2. The audio fingerprint is created by analyzing the song's spectral features and creating a compact representation
3. The fingerprint is stored in the Fingerprint Database along with the song's metadata

Song Identification:
1. When a user records an audio clip using the Mobile Client, the clip is sent to the Song Matching Service via the API Gateway
2. The Song Matching Service extracts the fingerprint from the audio clip using the same fingerprinting algorithm used for the database songs
3. The extracted fingerprint is compared against the fingerprints in the Fingerprint Database to find the closest match
4. If a match is found, the corresponding song metadata is retrieved from the Metadata Database
5. The matching song details are cached in the Result Cache for faster retrieval in case of subsequent requests for the same song
6. The matching song details are returned to the Mobile Client via the API Gateway

Database Sharding:
1. To handle a large number of songs and improve search performance, the Fingerprint Database can be sharded based on the fingerprint
2. Each shard can be assigned a range of fingerprints, and the Song Matching Service can determine the appropriate shard to search based on the extracted fingerprint
3. Sharding allows for parallel searching across multiple machines, improving the scalability and performance of the system

**Step 5: Scalability, Performance, Consistency, Availability**

Scalability:
- **The system can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances of the Song Matching Service to handle increased load**
- **The Fingerprint Database can be sharded based on the fingerprint to distribute the data and search load across multiple machines**
- **The Result Cache can be distributed across multiple nodes to handle high read traffic and improve response times**

Performance:
- **The audio fingerprinting algorithm should be optimized for fast fingerprint generation and matching**
- **The Fingerprint Database should be indexed efficiently to enable fast lookups during the matching process**
- **The Result Cache should be used to store frequently requested song details, reducing the load on the database and improving response times**
- **The Song Matching Service can be optimized to perform parallel searches across multiple shards of the Fingerprint Database**

Consistency:
- **The Metadata Database should provide strong consistency for song metadata to ensure accurate information is returned to users**
- **The Fingerprint Database can afford eventual consistency as the fingerprints are immutable and do not require real-time updates**

Availability:
- **The system should be designed for high availability by deploying multiple instances of the Song Matching Service and API Gateway across different regions or data centers**
- **The Fingerprint Database and Metadata Database should have replication and failover mechanisms to ensure data durability and availability**
- **The Result Cache should be distributed and replicated to handle node failures and ensure continuous availability**

**Summary of Key Points**

To design an audio recognition system like Shazam:

1. Use audio fingerprinting techniques to generate unique and compact representations of songs
2. Store song fingerprints in a **sharded Fingerprint Database** for efficient matching and scalability
3. Use a **relational database** for storing song metadata and a **non-relational database** for storing audio fingerprints
4. Implement a **Song Matching Service** to extract fingerprints from audio clips and match them against the database
5. Utilize a **Result Cache** to store frequently requested song details and improve response times
6. Ensure **scalability** by horizontally scaling the Song Matching Service, sharding the Fingerprint Database, and distributing the Result Cache
7. Optimize **performance** through efficient fingerprinting algorithms, indexing, and parallel search across shards
8. Provide **strong consistency** for song metadata and allow **eventual consistency** for fingerprints
9. Design for **high availability** by deploying multiple instances of services, implementing replication and failover for databases, and distributing the Result Cache

The key insights are to use audio fingerprinting for efficient song matching, shard the Fingerprint Database for scalability, utilize a Result Cache for improved performance, ensure strong consistency for metadata and eventual consistency for fingerprints, and design for high availability through redundancy and replication.
