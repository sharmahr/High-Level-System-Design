Here is my solution to designing a concurrent online auction system:

**Step 1: Clarify Requirements and Assumptions**

- The auction system should allow sellers to create auctions for items with a starting price and an expiration time
- Buyers should be able to place bids on auction items until the auction expires
- The system should handle concurrent bids from multiple buyers and ensure that the highest bid wins the auction
- The system should notify the seller and the winning bidder when the auction ends
- The system should handle a high volume of concurrent auctions and bids
- The system should ensure fairness and prevent any fraudulent activities
- Assume the system needs to support 100,000 concurrent auctions
- Assume an average of 1,000 bids per auction
- Assume an average auction duration of 24 hours

**Step 2: Back of the Envelope Estimations**

- Number of concurrent auctions: 100,000
- Average bids per auction: 1,000
- Total bids for all auctions: 100,000 * 1,000 = 100 million
- Assuming each bid record is 100 bytes, total storage for bids: 100 million * 100 bytes ≈ 10 GB
- Assuming each auction record is 1 KB, total storage for auctions: 100,000 * 1 KB ≈ 100 MB
- Assuming 10% of auctions end per hour, peak update rate: 100,000 * 0.1 = 10,000 updates per hour

**Step 3: High-Level Architecture**

API Design:
- `createAuction(sellerId, itemDetails, startingPrice, expirationTime)`: Create a new auction
- `placeBid(auctionId, buyerId, bidAmount)`: Place a bid on an auction
- `getAuction(auctionId)`: Retrieve details of a specific auction
- `getAuctionsByUser(userId)`: Retrieve auctions created by a specific user
- `searchAuctions(query, filters)`: Search for auctions based on keywords and filters
- `processAuctionEnd(auctionId)`: Process the end of an auction and determine the winner

Data Model:
- Auction:
  - auctionId (unique identifier)
  - sellerId (foreign key to User)
  - itemDetails (title, description, images)
  - startingPrice
  - currentPrice
  - expirationTime
  - status (active, ended)
  - ...
- Bid:
  - bidId (unique identifier)
  - auctionId (foreign key to Auction)
  - buyerId (foreign key to User)
  - bidAmount
  - timestamp
  - ...
- User:
  - userId (unique identifier)
  - email
  - password (hashed)
  - name
  - ...

Database:
- A combination of relational and non-relational databases can be used
- Auction and User data can be stored in a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for structured data and efficient querying
- Bid data can be stored in a non-relational database (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) for scalability and high write throughput
- A caching system (e.g., Redis) can be used to store frequently accessed data, such as active auctions and high bids
- A message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) can be used to handle the processing of auction end events

Key Components:
- API Gateway: Acts as the entry point for client requests, performs request routing, authentication, and authorization
- Auction Service: Handles the creation and management of auctions, including updating auction details and determining auction winners
- Bid Service: Handles the placement and processing of bids on auctions
- User Service: Manages user accounts and authentication
- Cache: Stores frequently accessed data, such as active auctions and high bids, for faster retrieval
- Auction Ending Processor: Processes the ending of auctions and determines the winning bidder
- Message Queue: Handles the asynchronous processing of auction end events to ensure proper handling of concurrent auctions

**Step 4: Detailed Design**

Creating an Auction:
1. The seller sends a request to create an auction through the API Gateway
2. The API Gateway authenticates the seller and routes the request to the Auction Service
3. The Auction Service validates the auction details and creates a new auction record in the database
4. The Auction Service returns the created auction details to the seller

Placing a Bid:
1. The buyer sends a request to place a bid on an auction through the API Gateway
2. The API Gateway authenticates the buyer and routes the request to the Bid Service
3. The Bid Service retrieves the current highest bid from the Cache
4. If the new bid is higher than the current highest bid, the Bid Service updates the highest bid in the Cache and creates a new bid record in the database
5. If the new bid is lower than or equal to the current highest bid, the Bid Service rejects the bid
6. The Bid Service returns the bid status to the buyer

Auction Ending:
1. When an auction reaches its expiration time, the Auction Service sends an auction end event to the Message Queue
2. The Auction Ending Processor consumes the auction end event from the Message Queue
3. The Auction Ending Processor retrieves the final highest bid from the Cache and determines the winning bidder
4. The Auction Ending Processor updates the auction status to "ended" and stores the winning bidder information in the database
5. The Auction Ending Processor sends notifications to the seller and the winning bidder about the auction result

**Step 5: Scalability, Performance, Consistency, Availability**

Scalability:
- **The system can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances of the Auction Service and Bid Service to handle increased load**
- **The Cache can be distributed across multiple nodes to handle a high volume of read and write operations**
- **The Message Queue can be scaled by adding more consumers to process auction end events concurrently**
- **The databases can be sharded based on auction ID or user ID to distribute the data across multiple nodes**

Performance:
- **Caching the current highest bid for each auction reduces the load on the database and improves bid processing performance**
- **Using a Message Queue for asynchronous processing of auction end events ensures that the system can handle a high volume of concurrent auctions ending**
- **Indexing the database tables on frequently queried fields, such as auction ID and user ID, improves query performance**
- **Implementing rate limiting and throttling mechanisms prevents abuse and ensures fair access to the system for all users**

Consistency:
- **The system should ensure strong consistency for placing bids and updating the highest bid to prevent race conditions and ensure fairness**
- **The Auction Ending Processor should use a distributed locking mechanism to handle concurrent auction end events and determine the winning bidder consistently**
- **Atomic operations and transactions should be used when updating the auction status and storing the winning bidder information**

Availability:
- **The system should be designed for high availability by deploying multiple instances of the services across different availability zones or regions**
- **Load balancers can be used to distribute traffic evenly across the service instances and handle failures**
- **The Cache and Message Queue should be replicated and have failover mechanisms to ensure data availability and resilience**
- **Regular backups of the databases should be performed to enable quick recovery in case of data loss or system failures**

**Summary of Key Points**

To design a concurrent online auction system:

1. Use a combination of **relational and non-relational databases** to store structured auction and user data, and scalable bid data
2. Implement an **API Gateway** for request routing, authentication, and authorization
3. Develop separate services for **auction management, bid processing, and user management**
4. Utilize a **Cache** to store frequently accessed data, such as active auctions and high bids, for faster retrieval
5. Use a **Message Queue** to handle the asynchronous processing of auction end events and ensure proper handling of concurrent auctions
6. Implement an **Auction Ending Processor** to determine the winning bidder and handle auction end notifications
7. Ensure **scalability** by designing the system for horizontal scaling, distributing the Cache and Message Queue, and sharding the databases
8. Optimize **performance** through caching, asynchronous processing, database indexing, and rate limiting/throttling mechanisms
9. Maintain **strong consistency** for placing bids and updating the highest bid, and use distributed locking for consistent auction ending
10. Design for **high availability** by deploying multiple service instances, implementing load balancing, and ensuring data replication and backup

The key insights are to use a combination of relational and non-relational databases for different data types, develop separate services for auction management and bid processing, utilize caching and a message queue for performance and scalability, ensure strong consistency for critical operations, and design for high availability through redundancy and failover mechanisms.
