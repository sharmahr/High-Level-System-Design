Here is my solution to designing a social media platform like Instagram:

**Step 1: Clarify Requirements and Assumptions**

- The social media platform should allow users to create accounts, follow other users, and share content (e.g., photos, videos, stories)
- Users should be able to like, comment on, and share posts from other users
- The platform should provide a personalized feed of content based on user preferences and interactions
- Users should be able to discover new content and users through search and explore features
- The platform should support direct messaging between users
- The platform should handle a large number of concurrent users and high volumes of content
- Assume the platform needs to support 100 million daily active users
- Assume an average of 10 million new posts per day
- Assume an average of 1 billion reactions (likes, comments) per day

**Step 2: Back of the Envelope Estimations**

- Number of daily active users: 100 million
- Average new posts per day: 10 million
- Average reactions per day: 1 billion
- Assuming an average post size of 1 MB (including photos and videos), total storage per day: 10 million * 1 MB = 10 TB
- Assuming an average user data size of 100 KB (profile information, preferences), total user data: 100 million * 100 KB ≈ 10 TB
- Assuming data is stored for 5 years, total storage required: (10 TB * 365 days * 5 years) + 10 TB ≈ 18 PB

**Step 3: High-Level Architecture**

API Design:
- `createUser(username, email, password)`: Creates a new user account
- `loginUser(username, password)`: Authenticates a user and returns an access token
- `createPost(userId, content, media)`: Creates a new post with text content and media (photos/videos)
- `getNewsFeed(userId, page, limit)`: Retrieves a user's personalized news feed with pagination
- `likePost(userId, postId)`: Allows a user to like a post
- `commentPost(userId, postId, comment)`: Allows a user to comment on a post
- `searchUsers(query)`: Searches for users based on username or name
- `exploreContent(userId, page, limit)`: Retrieves a curated list of popular content for exploration

Data Model:
- User:
  - userId (unique identifier for the user)
  - username
  - email
  - password (hashed)
  - profilePicture
  - bio
  - followersCount
  - followingCount
  - ...
- Post:
  - postId (unique identifier for the post)
  - userId (foreign key to User)
  - content
  - media (list of media objects)
  - likesCount
  - commentsCount
  - timestamp
  - ...
- Media:
  - mediaId (unique identifier for the media)
  - postId (foreign key to Post)
  - type (photo, video)
  - url
  - ...
- Reaction:
  - reactionId (unique identifier for the reaction)
  - userId (foreign key to User)
  - postId (foreign key to Post)
  - type (like, comment)
  - timestamp
  - ...
- Comment:
  - commentId (unique identifier for the comment)
  - userId (foreign key to User)
  - postId (foreign key to Post)
  - content
  - timestamp
  - ...

Database:
- A combination of relational and non-relational databases can be used
- User data can be stored in a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for structured data and efficient querying
- Post and Media data can be stored in a non-relational database (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) for scalability and high write throughput
- Reaction and Comment data can be stored in a non-relational database for fast writes and eventual consistency
- A distributed cache (e.g., Redis) can be used to store frequently accessed data, such as user sessions and news feed cache

High-Level Design:

Key Components:
- API Gateway: Acts as the entry point for client requests, handles authentication, and routes requests to the appropriate services
- User Service: Manages user accounts, authentication, and user-related data
- Post Service: Handles the creation, retrieval, and interaction with user-generated posts
- Feed Service: Generates personalized news feeds for users based on their preferences and interactions
- Media Storage: Stores and serves user-uploaded media files (photos and videos)
- Cache: Stores frequently accessed data, such as user sessions and news feed cache, for faster retrieval
- Search & Explore: Enables users to search for other users and discover new content

**Step 4: Detailed Design**

User Flow:
1. A user creates an account by providing the necessary information through the User Service
2. The user logs in and receives an access token from the User Service
3. The user can create a new post by uploading media files and adding text content through the Post Service
4. The Post Service stores the post data in the database and the media files in the Media Storage
5. The Feed Service generates a personalized news feed for each user based on their followed users and interactions
6. The user can like, comment on, and share posts from their news feed
7. The Reaction and Comment data are stored in the database and associated with the respective posts
8. The Search & Explore component allows users to search for other users and discover new content based on various factors (e.g., trending topics, similar interests)

Newsfeed Generation:
1. The Feed Service retrieves the list of users followed by the current user
2. For each followed user, the Feed Service retrieves their recent posts
3. The retrieved posts are ranked and sorted based on various factors, such as recency, user engagement, and content relevance
4. The Feed Service applies additional filters and personalization algorithms to curate the final news feed
5. The generated news feed is cached for a certain period to improve performance and reduce database load
6. The Feed Service returns the personalized news feed to the client for display

**Step 5: Scalability, Performance, Consistency, Availability**

Scalability:
- **The system can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances of the User Service, Post Service, and Feed Service to handle increased load**
- **The Media Storage can be distributed across multiple storage nodes or use a distributed file system (e.g., HDFS) for scalability**
- **The Cache can be scaled by adding more nodes to the cache cluster and partitioning the data based on user or content**
- **The databases can be sharded based on user ID or post ID to distribute the data and processing load**

Performance:
- **Caching frequently accessed data, such as user sessions and news feed cache, can significantly improve read performance**
- **The Feed Service can generate news feeds asynchronously and store them in the cache for faster retrieval**
- **The Post Service can leverage techniques like lazy loading and pagination to efficiently load and display posts**
- **The Media Storage can utilize content delivery networks (CDNs) to serve media files quickly to users across different geographical locations**

Consistency:
- **The system can tolerate eventual consistency for non-critical data, such as post likes and comments, to improve performance**
- **Strong consistency should be ensured for critical data, such as user accounts and post ownership, to maintain data integrity**
- **Atomic operations and transactions can be used to ensure consistency when updating multiple data entities simultaneously**

Availability:
- **The system should be designed for high availability by deploying services across multiple availability zones or regions**
- **Load balancing techniques should be employed to distribute traffic evenly across service instances**
- **Failover mechanisms should be implemented to automatically route requests to healthy instances in case of failures**
- **Data replication and backup strategies should be in place to ensure data durability and quick recovery in case of disasters**

**Summary of Key Points**

To design a social media platform like Instagram:

1. Use a **combination of relational and non-relational databases** to store user data, posts, media files, reactions, and comments
2. Implement an **API Gateway** to handle client requests, authentication, and routing to appropriate services
3. Develop separate services for **user management, post handling, news feed generation, and search/explore functionality**
4. Utilize a **Media Storage** solution to store and serve user-uploaded media files efficiently
5. Employ a **Cache** to store frequently accessed data, such as user sessions and news feed cache, for faster retrieval
6. Design a **Feed Service** to generate personalized news feeds based on user preferences and interactions
7. Implement **search and explore features** to enable user discovery and content exploration
8. Ensure **scalability** by horizontally scaling services, distributing media storage, and sharding databases
9. Optimize **performance** through caching, asynchronous processing, lazy loading, and content delivery networks (CDNs)
10. Maintain **strong consistency** for critical data and allow eventual consistency for non-critical data to improve performance
11. Design for **high availability** by deploying services across multiple zones, implementing failover mechanisms, and ensuring data durability

The key insights are to use a combination of relational and non-relational databases to handle different data types and access patterns, develop separate services for user management, post handling, news feed generation, and search/explore functionality, utilize a Media Storage solution for efficient storage and retrieval of media files, and ensure scalability, performance, consistency, and availability through appropriate architectural decisions and techniques.
