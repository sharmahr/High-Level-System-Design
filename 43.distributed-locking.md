Here is my solution to designing a distributed locking service:

**Step 1: Clarify Requirements and Assumptions**

- The locking service should allow clients to acquire and release locks on shared resources
- Locks should be exclusive, meaning only one client can hold a lock on a resource at a time
- The locking service should support lock expiration to prevent deadlocks caused by clients holding locks indefinitely
- The locking service should be highly available and fault-tolerant
- The locking service should be scalable to handle a large number of clients and resources
- The locking service should provide strong consistency guarantees for lock operations
- Assume the system needs to support 10,000 clients and 1 million shared resources
- Assume an average of 1,000 lock requests per second during peak usage

**Step 2: Back of the Envelope Estimations**

- Number of clients: 10,000
- Number of shared resources: 1 million
- Average lock requests per second during peak usage: 1,000
- Assuming each lock request takes 10 ms to process, the system should be able to handle: 1 second / 10 ms = 100 requests per second per node
- To handle 1,000 requests per second, the system needs at least: 1,000 / 100 = 10 nodes
- Assuming each lock entry is 100 bytes and we have 1 million resources, total storage: 1,000,000 * 100 bytes ≈ 100 MB

**Step 3: High-Level Architecture**

API Design:
- `acquireLock(resourceId, clientId, expirationTime)`: Acquires a lock on a resource for a client with an optional expiration time
- `releaseLock(resourceId, clientId)`: Releases a lock held by a client on a resource
- `renewLock(resourceId, clientId, expirationTime)`: Renews the expiration time of a lock held by a client on a resource

Data Model:
- Lock:
  - resourceId (unique identifier of the resource)
  - clientId (identifier of the client holding the lock)
  - expirationTime (timestamp when the lock expires)
  - ...

Database:
- A distributed key-value store (e.g., etcd, ZooKeeper, Consul) can be used to store lock information
- The key-value store should provide strong consistency and fault-tolerance
- The key-value store should support atomic operations for acquiring and releasing locks

High-Level Design:

```

Key Components:
- API Server: Handles client requests for acquiring, releasing, and renewing locks
- Lock Coordinator: Implements the locking logic and communicates with the distributed key-value store for lock management
- Distributed Key-Value Store: Stores lock information and provides strong consistency and fault-tolerance

**Step 4: Detailed Design**

Lock Acquisition:
1. When a client wants to acquire a lock on a resource, it sends a request to the API Server
2. The API Server forwards the request to the Lock Coordinator
3. The Lock Coordinator generates a unique lock entry with the resourceId, clientId, and expirationTime
4. The Lock Coordinator tries to write the lock entry to the distributed key-value store using an atomic operation
5. If the write succeeds, it means the lock is successfully acquired, and the Lock Coordinator returns a success response to the client
6. If the write fails (due to a lock already existing), the Lock Coordinator returns a failure response to the client

Lock Release:
1. When a client wants to release a lock on a resource, it sends a request to the API Server
2. The API Server forwards the request to the Lock Coordinator
3. The Lock Coordinator verifies if the lock exists and if the clientId matches the lock holder
4. If the verification succeeds, the Lock Coordinator removes the lock entry from the distributed key-value store using an atomic operation
5. The Lock Coordinator returns a success response to the client

Lock Renewal:
1. When a client wants to renew a lock on a resource, it sends a request to the API Server with the new expirationTime
2. The API Server forwards the request to the Lock Coordinator
3. The Lock Coordinator verifies if the lock exists and if the clientId matches the lock holder
4. If the verification succeeds, the Lock Coordinator updates the expirationTime of the lock entry in the distributed key-value store using an atomic operation
5. The Lock Coordinator returns a success response to the client

Fault Tolerance and High Availability:
1. Multiple instances of the API Server and Lock Coordinator are deployed across different nodes for fault tolerance and high availability
2. The distributed key-value store replicates data across multiple nodes to ensure data durability and availability
3. If a Lock Coordinator node fails, the API Server can route requests to another available Lock Coordinator node
4. The distributed key-value store ensures data consistency and handles node failures transparently

**Step 5: Scalability, Performance, Consistency, Availability**

Scalability:
- **The system can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances of the API Server and Lock Coordinator to handle increased load**
- **The distributed key-value store can be scaled by adding more nodes to the cluster and distributing data across nodes**
- **Sharding can be used to partition the lock data based on the resourceId to distribute the load across multiple nodes**

Performance:
- **The use of a distributed key-value store with strong consistency allows for fast and reliable lock operations**
- **The Lock Coordinator can be optimized to handle a high volume of lock requests by using efficient algorithms and data structures**
- **Caching can be used to store frequently accessed lock information to reduce the load on the distributed key-value store**

Consistency:
- **The distributed key-value store provides strong consistency guarantees for lock operations**
- **Atomic operations are used for acquiring and releasing locks to ensure data integrity and prevent race conditions**
- **The Lock Coordinator ensures that only one client can hold a lock on a resource at a time**

Availability:
- **The system is designed for high availability by deploying multiple instances of the API Server and Lock Coordinator across different nodes**
- **The distributed key-value store replicates data across multiple nodes to ensure data durability and availability**
- **If a node fails, the system can continue operating using the available nodes, ensuring minimal disruption to clients**

**Summary of Key Points**

To design a distributed locking service:

1. Use a **distributed key-value store** (e.g., etcd, ZooKeeper, Consul) for storing lock information and providing strong consistency and fault-tolerance
2. Implement an **API Server** to handle client requests for acquiring, releasing, and renewing locks
3. Design a **Lock Coordinator** to implement the locking logic and communicate with the distributed key-value store
4. Ensure **scalability** by horizontally scaling the API Server and Lock Coordinator, and using sharding to distribute lock data across nodes
5. Optimize **performance** by using efficient algorithms and data structures, and leveraging caching for frequently accessed lock information
6. Provide **strong consistency** guarantees for lock operations using the distributed key-value store and atomic operations
7. Ensure **high availability** by deploying multiple instances of the API Server and Lock Coordinator, and replicating data across nodes in the distributed key-value store

The key insights are to use a distributed key-value store for storing lock information and providing strong consistency, design a scalable architecture with an API Server and Lock Coordinator, optimize performance through efficient algorithms and caching, ensure strong consistency for lock operations, and achieve high availability through redundancy and replication.
