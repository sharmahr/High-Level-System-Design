Here is my solution to designing a URL shortener service:

**Step 1: Clarify Requirements and Assumptions**

- The URL shortener service should generate short, unique URLs that redirect to longer, original URLs
- The short URLs should be as short as possible for ease of sharing and memorability
- The service should support a high volume of URL shortening and redirection requests
- The service should provide analytics and tracking information for shortened URLs
- The service should handle edge cases, such as expiration and deletion of shortened URLs
- Assume the service needs to handle 100 million new URL shortenings per month
- Assume a redirection ratio of 10:1 (10 redirections for every shortened URL)
- Assume the average size of a URL is 100 characters

**Step 2: Back of the Envelope Estimations**

- New URL shortenings per month: 100 million
- Redirections per month: 100 million * 10 = 1 billion
- Assume a 5-year retention period for shortened URLs
- Total number of shortened URLs over 5 years: 100 million * 12 months * 5 years = 6 billion
- Average size of a URL: 100 characters (assuming ASCII encoding)
- Storage requirements for URLs: 6 billion * 100 characters = 600 GB

**Step 3: High-Level Architecture**

API Design:
- `createShortURL(longURL)`: Creates a new short URL for the given long URL
- `getLongURL(shortURL)`: Retrieves the original long URL associated with a short URL
- `deleteShortURL(shortURL)`: Deletes a short URL and its associated long URL
- `getAnalytics(shortURL)`: Retrieves analytics data for a short URL (e.g., number of clicks, geolocation, etc.)

Data Model:
- ShortURL:
  - shortURL (primary key)
  - longURL
  - createdAt
  - expiresAt (optional)
- URLAnalytics:
  - id (primary key)
  - shortURL (foreign key to ShortURL)
  - timestamp
  - userAgent
  - referrer
  - geolocation

Database:
- A combination of relational and NoSQL databases can be used
- Relational Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL):
  - Stores the mapping between short URLs and long URLs
  - Provides strong consistency and ACID properties
- NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra):
  - Stores URL analytics data
  - Provides scalability and high write throughput

Key Components:
- API Gateway: Acts as the entry point for client requests and handles request routing, authentication, and rate limiting
- URL Shortener Service: Handles the creation and retrieval of short URLs, and manages the mapping between short and long URLs
- Analytics Service: Collects and processes analytics data for shortened URLs
- Cache (Redis): Stores frequently accessed short URL mappings for faster retrieval
- Relational Database: Stores the mapping between short URLs and long URLs
- NoSQL Database: Stores URL analytics data for scalability and high write throughput

**Step 4: Detailed Design**

URL Shortening:
1. When a client requests to create a short URL, the API Gateway forwards the request to the URL Shortener Service
2. The URL Shortener Service generates a unique short URL using a predefined algorithm (e.g., base62 encoding, hash function)
3. The service checks the Relational Database to ensure the short URL doesn't already exist
4. If the short URL is unique, the service stores the mapping between the short URL and long URL in the Relational Database
5. The service returns the short URL to the client via the API Gateway

URL Redirection:
1. When a client requests a short URL, the API Gateway forwards the request to the URL Shortener Service
2. The service first checks the Cache to see if the short URL mapping exists
3. If the mapping is found in the Cache, the service retrieves the long URL and returns a redirect response to the client
4. If the mapping is not found in the Cache, the service retrieves the long URL from the Relational Database
5. The service stores the short URL mapping in the Cache for future requests
6. The service returns a redirect response to the client, redirecting them to the original long URL

Analytics:
1. When a short URL is accessed, the Analytics Service captures relevant data (e.g., timestamp, user agent, referrer, geolocation)
2. The Analytics Service stores the data in the NoSQL Database for scalability and high write throughput
3. The service can process and aggregate the analytics data to provide insights and metrics
4. Clients can retrieve analytics data for a specific short URL through the API Gateway

Caching:
- Frequently accessed short URL mappings are cached in Redis for faster retrieval
- The Cache is updated whenever a new short URL is created or an existing one is accessed
- The Cache can be configured with an expiration policy to remove stale mappings and maintain a manageable size

**Step 5: Scalability, Performance, Consistency, Availability**

Scalability:
- **The URL Shortener Service can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances behind a load balancer to handle increased traffic**
- **The Relational Database can be sharded based on the short URL to distribute the data across multiple nodes**
- **The NoSQL Database can be scaled horizontally by adding more nodes to handle increased write throughput for analytics data**
- **The Cache can be distributed across multiple Redis instances to handle high read throughput**

Performance:
- **Caching frequently accessed short URL mappings in Redis reduces the latency of URL redirection requests**
- **The URL Shortener Service can be optimized to generate short URLs efficiently and minimize collision probability**
- **The Analytics Service can process and aggregate data asynchronously to avoid impacting the performance of URL redirection**

Consistency:
- **The Relational Database provides strong consistency for the mapping between short URLs and long URLs**
- **The Cache can be configured with a consistency policy (e.g., write-through, write-back) to ensure data consistency with the Relational Database**
- **Eventual consistency can be acceptable for analytics data stored in the NoSQL Database**

Availability:
- **The URL Shortener Service can be deployed across multiple availability zones or regions to ensure high availability**
- **The Relational Database can be replicated using a primary-secondary setup or a multi-primary setup for increased availability**
- **The NoSQL Database can be configured with replication and automatic failover to handle node failures**
- **The Cache can be configured with high availability using Redis Sentinel or Redis Cluster**

**Summary of Key Points**

To design a URL shortener service, consider the following key points:

1. Use a combination of a relational database for storing short URL mappings and a NoSQL database for storing analytics data
2. Implement an API Gateway to handle request routing, authentication, and rate limiting
3. Design a URL Shortener Service to handle the creation and retrieval of short URLs, and manage the mapping between short and long URLs
4. Use a Cache (e.g., Redis) to store frequently accessed short URL mappings for faster retrieval
5. Implement an Analytics Service to capture and process analytics data for shortened URLs
6. Ensure scalability by horizontally scaling the URL Shortener Service, sharding the Relational Database, and scaling the NoSQL Database and Cache
7. Optimize performance through caching, efficient short URL generation, and asynchronous processing of analytics data
8. Maintain strong consistency for the short URL mappings using a Relational Database and a consistent caching policy
9. Ensure high availability by deploying services across multiple availability zones or regions, replicating databases, and configuring the Cache for high availability
