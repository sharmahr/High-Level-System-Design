Here is my solution to designing a unique ID generator in distributed systems:

**Step 1: Clarify Requirements and Assumptions**

- The system should generate unique IDs across multiple distributed nodes
- IDs should be roughly sortable by time (i.e., later IDs should be greater than earlier IDs)
- IDs should be as short as possible to save storage space
- The system should be highly scalable and able to handle a high volume of ID generation requests
- The system should have minimal coordination between nodes to avoid performance bottlenecks
- Assume the IDs are 64-bit integers
- Assume the system needs to generate 10,000 IDs per second at peak

**Step 2: Back of the Envelope Estimations**

- Assume we need to generate 1 trillion unique IDs over the lifetime of the system
- With 64-bit IDs, we have a total space of 2^64 ≈ 18 quintillion IDs
- To generate 10,000 IDs per second, we need a throughput of 10,000 * 86400 ≈ 864 million IDs per day
- At this rate, the system can generate unique IDs for 1 trillion / 864 million ≈ 1,157,407 days ≈ 3,170 years

**Step 3: High-Level Architecture**

API Design:
- `generateId()`: Returns a new unique ID

Data Model:
- IDs are 64-bit integers
- IDs are composed of multiple parts: timestamp, node ID, sequence number

Database:
- No database is required for ID generation itself
- However, generated IDs will likely be stored in a database along with the associated data
- The choice of database (relational vs. non-relational) depends on the specific use case and data model
- For example, if the data has a fixed schema and requires strong consistency, a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL may be appropriate
- If the data is unstructured or semi-structured and requires high scalability and availability, a non-relational database like MongoDB or Cassandra may be a better fit

High-Level Design:

Key Components:
- Router: Receives client requests and forwards them to the appropriate node for ID generation
- ID Generator: Generates unique IDs on each node independently
- Each node has its own ID generator instance to avoid coordination overhead

To ensure that unique IDs generated from different nodes are indeed unique across the entire system, we can use a combination of techniques. Here's a high-level overview of how we can achieve this:

1. **Centralized ID Generator**: Implement a centralized service or component responsible for generating unique IDs. This service will be accessed by all nodes in the system whenever they need to generate an ID.

2. **Distributed ID Generation**: Utilize a distributed ID generation algorithm that ensures uniqueness across multiple nodes. One popular approach is using a combination of timestamp, node ID, and sequence number.

3. **Node-Specific Configuration**: Each node in the system should be configured with a unique identifier (node ID) that distinguishes it from other nodes. This could be achieved through manual configuration or automatic assignment during node initialization.

4. **Timestamp-Based Ordering**: Use timestamps as part of the ID generation process to ensure that IDs generated by different nodes are ordered chronologically. This helps maintain the order of IDs across the system.

5. **Sequence Numbers**: Incorporate sequence numbers to handle scenarios where multiple requests for IDs are made simultaneously from different nodes. Each node maintains its own sequence counter, ensuring that generated IDs are unique even during concurrent requests.

6. **Communication and Synchronization**: Implement communication and synchronization mechanisms between nodes and the centralized ID generation service to coordinate ID generation requests. This ensures that IDs are generated in a coordinated manner and prevents conflicts.

7. **Fault Tolerance and Resilience**: Design the system to be fault-tolerant and resilient against failures. This includes handling network partitions, node failures, and ensuring that ID generation continues uninterrupted even in adverse conditions.

8. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring and logging mechanisms to track ID generation activities across nodes. This helps in identifying any anomalies or issues related to ID generation and facilitates troubleshooting.

By combining these techniques, we can ensure that unique IDs generated from different nodes in the system are indeed unique and maintain consistency and orderliness across the entire system.

**Step 4: Detailed Design**

ID Format:
- 64-bit integer composed of:
  - 41 bits for timestamp in milliseconds (allows for 69 years of unique timestamps)
  - 10 bits for node ID (allows for 1024 nodes)
  - 12 bits for sequence number (allows for 4096 IDs per millisecond per node)
- 1 bit is left unused for future use

ID Generation:
- Each node generates IDs independently using its own ID generator instance
- The ID generator keeps track of the last timestamp and sequence number used
- To generate a new ID:
  1. Get the current timestamp in milliseconds
  2. If the timestamp is the same as the last one, increment the sequence number
  3. If the sequence number overflows, wait until the next millisecond
  4. If the timestamp is greater than the last one, reset the sequence number to 0
  5. Combine the timestamp, node ID, and sequence number to form the final ID

Coordination:
- Nodes do not need to coordinate with each other to generate IDs
- The node ID ensures that IDs generated by different nodes are unique
- The timestamp and sequence number ensure that IDs are roughly sortable by time

**Step 5: Scalability, Performance, Consistency, Availability**

Scalability:
- **The system can scale horizontally by adding more nodes**
- **Each node generates IDs independently, so there is no coordination overhead**
- The router can be scaled by adding more instances and using a load balancer

Performance:
- **ID generation is very fast since it only involves local operations on each node**
- **The system can handle a high volume of requests by scaling horizontally**
- The router can become a bottleneck, but can be scaled by adding more instances

Consistency:
- **IDs are guaranteed to be unique across all nodes**
- IDs are roughly sortable by time, but there may be some out-of-order IDs due to clock skew between nodes

Availability:
- **The system is highly available since each node generates IDs independently**
- If a node fails, the other nodes can continue generating IDs without interruption
- The router can be made highly available by running multiple instances and using a load balancer

**Summary of Key Points**

To design a scalable and highly available unique ID generator in distributed systems:

1. Use a **64-bit ID format** composed of timestamp, node ID, and sequence number
2. **Generate IDs independently on each node** to avoid coordination overhead
3. Use the **timestamp and sequence number to ensure rough time ordering** of IDs
4. Use the **node ID to ensure uniqueness** of IDs across nodes
5. **Scale horizontally by adding more nodes**, each with its own ID generator instance
6. Make the **router scalable and highly available** by running multiple instances with a load balancer
7. Ensure **high performance** by using only local operations for ID generation on each node
8. Accept **eventual consistency** for ID ordering due to potential clock skew between nodes

The key insights are to use a composite ID format that includes a timestamp, node ID, and sequence number to ensure both uniqueness and rough time ordering, while allowing each node to generate IDs independently to avoid coordination overhead. Horizontal scalability and high availability are achieved by adding more nodes and using a scalable, highly available router. Some eventual consistency in ID ordering is accepted as a trade-off for scalability and performance. Let me know if you have any other questions!
