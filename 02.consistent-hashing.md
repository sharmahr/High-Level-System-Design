Here is my solution to designing consistent hashing:

**Step 1: Clarify Requirements and Assumptions**

- Consistent hashing is used to distribute data across a cluster of nodes in a way that minimizes data redistribution when nodes are added or removed
- The system should be able to map keys (e.g., object IDs) to nodes in the cluster
- The distribution of keys across nodes should be as uniform as possible
- The system should be able to handle the addition or removal of nodes without causing a complete remapping of keys
- Assume the system needs to handle a large number of keys (e.g., millions or billions)
- Assume the cluster size can vary from a few nodes to hundreds or thousands of nodes

**Step 2: Back of the Envelope Estimations**

- Assume the system needs to handle 1 billion keys
- Assume the average size of each key-value pair is 1 KB
- Total data size: 1 billion * 1 KB = 1 TB
- Assume the initial cluster size is 100 nodes
- Average keys per node: 1 billion / 100 = 10 million

**Step 3: High-Level Architecture**

API Design:
- `addNode(nodeId)`: Adds a new node to the cluster
- `removeNode(nodeId)`: Removes a node from the cluster
- `getNode(key)`: Returns the node responsible for storing the given key
- `put(key, value)`: Stores a key-value pair in the cluster
- `get(key)`: Retrieves the value associated with a key from the cluster

Data Model:
- Key: Unique identifier for the data object
- Value: The actual data object
- Node: Represents a node in the cluster, identified by a unique nodeId

Database:
- Consistent hashing is typically used in distributed key-value storage systems
- The choice of database depends on the specific requirements of the system
- Examples of databases that can be used with consistent hashing include:
  - Cassandra: A highly scalable, distributed NoSQL database
  - Redis: An in-memory data structure store that can be used as a distributed cache
  - DynamoDB: A fully managed NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services

Key Components:
- Hash Ring: Represents the range of hash values, typically from 0 to a large number (e.g., 2^32 - 1)
- Nodes: The servers or instances in the cluster that store the data
- Hash Function: A function that maps keys to positions on the hash ring

**Step 4: Detailed Design**

Consistent Hashing Algorithm:
1. Create a hash ring with a large range of hash values (e.g., 0 to 2^32 - 1)
2. Map each node to one or more positions on the hash ring using a hash function (e.g., SHA-256)
3. To determine the node responsible for a given key:
   - Hash the key using the same hash function used for nodes
   - Traverse the hash ring clockwise from the key's hash value
   - The first node encountered on the ring is responsible for storing the key-value pair
4. When a new node is added to the cluster:
   - Map the new node to one or more positions on the hash ring
   - Reassign the keys that fall between the new node and its predecessor to the new node
   - Only a fraction of the keys need to be remapped
5. When a node is removed from the cluster:
   - Remove the node from the hash ring
   - Reassign the keys that were stored on the removed node to its successor on the ring
   - Only the keys stored on the removed node need to be remapped

Virtual Nodes (Vnodes):
- To improve the uniformity of key distribution, each physical node can be assigned multiple virtual nodes (vnodes)
- Each vnode is mapped to a different position on the hash ring
- Keys are distributed across vnodes instead of physical nodes
- Vnodes help mitigate the impact of node additions and removals on key distribution

Replication:
- To ensure data availability and fault tolerance, data can be replicated across multiple nodes
- Each key-value pair can be stored on the primary node responsible for the key and also on a set of replica nodes
- Replica nodes can be chosen by traversing the hash ring clockwise from the primary node
- The number of replicas can be configured based on the desired level of fault tolerance

**Step 5: Scalability, Performance, Consistency, Availability**

Scalability:
- **Consistent hashing allows the system to scale horizontally by adding or removing nodes from the cluster**
- **When a new node is added, only a fraction of the keys need to be remapped, minimizing data movement**
- **The use of virtual nodes (vnodes) helps distribute keys more evenly across nodes, improving load balancing**

Performance:
- **The hash function used for consistent hashing should be fast to compute to minimize overhead**
- **Caching can be used to store frequently accessed key-value pairs in memory, reducing the load on the storage nodes**
- **Parallel retrieval of data from multiple nodes can improve read performance**

Consistency:
- **Consistent hashing provides a deterministic mapping of keys to nodes, ensuring that a key always maps to the same node unless the cluster topology changes**
- **Replication can be used to ensure data consistency across multiple nodes**
- **Consistency levels (e.g., quorum-based consistency) can be configured based on the specific requirements of the system**

Availability:
- **The use of replication helps ensure data availability in case of node failures**
- **When a node fails, its keys are automatically redistributed to the remaining nodes in the cluster**
- **The system can be designed to automatically detect and recover from node failures to minimize downtime**

**Summary of Key Points**

To design consistent hashing, consider the following key points:

1. Create a hash ring with a large range of hash values and map nodes to positions on the ring using a hash function
2. Use the same hash function to map keys to positions on the ring and assign them to the first node encountered clockwise
3. When adding or removing nodes, only a fraction of the keys need to be remapped, minimizing data movement
4. Use virtual nodes (vnodes) to improve the uniformity of key distribution and load balancing
5. Implement replication to ensure data availability and fault tolerance
6. Choose a fast hash function to minimize overhead and optimize performance
7. Utilize caching to store frequently accessed key-value pairs in memory and reduce load on storage nodes
8. Configure consistency levels based on the specific requirements of the system
9. Design the system to automatically detect and recover from node failures to ensure high availability

Remember to focus on the key aspects of consistent hashing, such as the hash ring, node mapping, key distribution, virtual nodes, replication, and fault tolerance. The choice of specific technologies and databases may vary based on the system requirements and existing infrastructure. Let me know if you have any further questions!
