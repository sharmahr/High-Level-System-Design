Here is my solution to designing Google Docs:

**Step 1: Clarify Requirements and Assumptions**

- Users should be able to create, edit, and collaborate on documents in real-time
- Multiple users should be able to edit the same document simultaneously
- Changes made by one user should be visible to other collaborators in real-time
- The system should support various formatting options (e.g., text styles, images, tables)
- The system should automatically save changes and maintain version history
- Users should be able to access documents from different devices (web, mobile)
- The system should ensure data privacy and security
- Assume the system needs to support 100 million daily active users
- Assume an average of 10 documents per user
- Assume an average document size of 100 KB

**Step 2: Back of the Envelope Estimations**

- Number of daily active users: 100 million
- Average documents per user: 10
- Total number of documents: 100 million * 10 = 1 billion
- Average document size: 100 KB
- Total storage required: 1 billion * 100 KB = 100 TB
- Assuming a 10% daily change rate, data changed per day: 100 TB * 0.1 = 10 TB
- Assuming 100 million daily active users, concurrent users during peak hours (1/10): 10 million

**Step 3: High-Level Architecture**

API Design:
- `createDocument(userId, title)`: Creates a new document for the user
- `getDocument(documentId)`: Retrieves the document content and metadata
- `updateDocument(documentId, changes)`: Applies the changes made by a user to the document
- `getCollaborators(documentId)`: Retrieves the list of collaborators for a document
- `addCollaborator(documentId, userId)`: Adds a user as a collaborator to the document
- `removeCollaborator(documentId, userId)`: Removes a user from the collaborators list

Data Model:
- Document:
  - documentId (unique identifier)
  - title
  - content
  - createdBy (user who created the document)
  - createdAt
  - updatedAt
  - collaborators (list of user IDs)
  - version (version number of the document)
- User:
  - userId (unique identifier)
  - name
  - email
  - ...

Database:
- A combination of relational and non-relational databases can be used
- Document metadata (title, collaborators, etc.) can be stored in a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for structured data and efficient querying
- Document content can be stored in a non-relational database (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB) for scalability and flexibility

Key Components:
- API Gateway: Handles client requests, performs authentication and authorization, and routes requests to the appropriate services
- Document Service: Manages the creation, retrieval, and updating of documents
- Collaboration Service: Handles real-time collaboration features, such as change tracking and presence
- Change Tracking: Tracks and synchronizes changes made by multiple users on the same document
- Presence Service: Manages the online/offline status of collaborators and updates the presence information in real-time
- Notification Service: Sends notifications to collaborators about document changes and updates
- Web Client: Provides the user interface for creating, editing, and collaborating on documents
- Database: Stores document metadata and content

**Step 4: Detailed Design**

Real-time Collaboration:
1. When a user makes changes to a document, the Web Client sends the changes to the Document Service via the API Gateway
2. The Document Service validates the changes and updates the document in the database
3. The Change Tracking component tracks the changes made by each user and maintains a version history
4. The Presence Service updates the online/offline status of collaborators in real-time
5. The Collaboration Service broadcasts the changes to all the collaborators' Web Clients in real-time
6. The Web Clients receive the changes and update the document view for each collaborator

Conflict Resolution:
1. When multiple users make changes to the same document simultaneously, conflicts may occur
2. The Change Tracking component detects conflicts by comparing the changes made by different users
3. The Collaboration Service resolves conflicts based on predefined rules (e.g., last write wins, manual merge)
4. The resolved changes are applied to the document and broadcasted to all collaborators

Notifications:
1. When a user is added or removed as a collaborator, the Notification Service sends a notification to the relevant users
2. When significant changes are made to a document (e.g., title change, major content update), the Notification Service sends notifications to the collaborators
3. Users can configure their notification preferences (e.g., email, push notifications) in the Web Client

**Step 5: Scalability, Performance, Consistency, Availability**

Scalability:
- **The system can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances of the Document Service and Collaboration Service to handle increased load**
- **The database can be sharded based on document ID to distribute the data across multiple nodes**
- **Caching can be used to store frequently accessed documents and metadata to reduce the load on the database**

Performance:
- **Real-time collaboration requires low-latency communication between the server and clients**
- **WebSocket or long-polling techniques can be used to enable real-time updates and minimize latency**
- **The Change Tracking component can efficiently track and merge changes made by multiple users**
- **The Presence Service can use heartbeat mechanisms to detect and update the online/offline status of collaborators quickly**

Consistency:
- **The system should ensure eventual consistency for document changes, allowing collaborators to see the most up-to-date version of the document**
- **Conflict resolution mechanisms should be in place to handle simultaneous changes made by multiple users**
- **The Change Tracking component should maintain a consistent version history of the document**

Availability:
- **The system should be designed for high availability by deploying multiple instances of the services across different regions or data centers**
- **Load balancers can distribute the traffic across the available instances to ensure optimal performance and fault tolerance**
- **The database should have replication and failover mechanisms to ensure data durability and availability**

**Summary of Key Points**

To design Google Docs:

1. Use a **combination of relational and non-relational databases** to store document metadata and content
2. Implement an **API Gateway** to handle client requests, authentication, and authorization
3. Design a **Document Service** to manage document creation, retrieval, and updates
4. Develop a **Collaboration Service** to handle real-time collaboration features, such as change tracking and presence
5. Utilize a **Change Tracking** component to track and synchronize changes made by multiple users
6. Implement a **Presence Service** to manage the online/offline status of collaborators in real-time
7. Use a **Notification Service** to send notifications to collaborators about document changes and updates
8. Ensure **scalability** by horizontally scaling the services, sharding the database, and using caching
9. Optimize **performance** through low-latency communication (WebSocket, long-polling) and efficient change tracking and merging
10. Maintain **eventual consistency** for document changes and implement conflict resolution mechanisms
11. Design for **high availability** by deploying multiple service instances, using load balancers, and ensuring database replication and failover

The key insights are to use a combination of relational and non-relational databases for storing document metadata and content, implement separate services for document management and collaboration, utilize real-time communication technologies for low-latency updates, ensure scalability through horizontal scaling and caching, maintain eventual consistency and handle conflicts, and design for high availability through redundancy and failover mechanisms.
